Generations of highly intellectual Central European agnostics and freethinkers had left in his bones a mistrust of the bogs and quicksands that lie beyond reality perceived. Speck described in the lightest possible manner how Henriette had followed her lover, a teacher of literature, to a depressed part of French-speaking Africa where the inhabitants were suffering from a shortage of Racine. He was as different from Gabriel as a tree is from the drawing of one; Gabriel at that time still imagined that everyone's life must be about the same, something like a half-worked crossword puzzle. For a time her letters were like the trail of a child going ever deeper into the woods. He could not decide whether or not to follow; while he was still deciding, and not deciding, the trail stopped and the path became overgrown behind her. Being entirely rational, he had a prudent respect for second sight. they bore out the expectation set alight by his reading, seeming to him classless and pagan, poetic and wise, imbued with an instinctive understanding of light, darkness, and immortality. Only the children were made uneasy by these strange new adults, so squat and ill-favored, so quarrelsome and sly, so destructive of nature and pointlessly cruel to animals. But, then, the children had not read much, were unfamiliar with films, and had no legends to guide them. The hospital stood near the graveyard \u2014 shamefully near, The mother he wanted did not stand in public squares pointing crazily up to invisible saints, or begin sleeping in one bed and end up in another. in four dark rooms stuffed with furniture, some of it useful. Only the Irish poor or the Royal Family ever wore mourning of that kind. It then happened that every person in the room, at the same moment, spoke and thought of something other than Alec. This lapse, this inattention, lasting no longer than was needed to say \u201cNo, thank you\u201d or \u201cOh, really?\u201d or \u201cYes, I see,\u201d was enough to create the dark gap marking the end of Alec's span. He ceased to be, and it made absolutely no difference after that whether or not he was forgotten. Grippes believed in the importance of errors. No political system, no love affair, no native inclination, no life itself would be tolerable without a wide mesh for mistakes to slip through. to depict life is to attract its ill-fortune, Grippes knew that one's view of the past is just as misleading as speculation about the future. secondhand, threadbare inkling of a world haunted by the belief that the best was outside one's scope or still to come. The invasion of strangers resembled the busloads of tourists arriving at Pompeii. They were disoriented and out of place. Recording with their cameras, they tried not to live the day but to fix a day not their own. It had so little to do with the present that something she had suspected became clear: there was no present here, and the strangers were perfectly correct to record, to stare, to giggle, to display the unease a healthy visitor feels in a hospital \u2014 the vague fear that a buried illness might emerge, obliging one to remain.

At the edge of the sea, the Fox departed. She saw the animal head breaking the water and the fan-shaped ripples diminishing against the shore. She turned her back and left the sea behind. At last she was going in the right direction. She rode Chief, her pony, between an alley of trees. Chief was a devil: he daren't bolt, or rear, but he sometimes tried to catch her leg against a tree. Nearby somebody smiled. She held herself straight. She was perfect. Everyone smiled now. Everyone was pleased. She emerged in triumph from the little wood and came off Chief, her pony, and into her father's arms. Leaving the church, narrowing his eyes against the bright street, he will remember other lives and other shadows of existence, some invented, some recalled. Grippes needs help with the past now. He wants a competent assistant who can live in his head and sort out the archives. A resident inspiring goddess, a muse of a kind, created by Grippes, used to keep offhand order, but her interest in him is slackening. She has no name, no face, no voice, no visible outline, yet he believes in her as some people do in mermaids or pieces of jade or a benevolent planet or simple luck. Denied substance, she cannot answer the door and stave off bores and meddlers. Actually, the custom of dropping small quantities of rubbish from a height is becoming endemic in his part of Paris. Not everyone has the nerve to splash paint or call a bus driver names or scribble all over a parking ticket before tearing it into strips, but to send flying a paper filter of wet coffee grounds and watch it burst on the roof of someone else's car is a way of saying something. Crank behavior is a large part of city life. the equivalent of the folding money every careful city dweller keeps on hand for muggers. He wished Theo would do something considerate, such as disappear. Peter Quennell, imagining Shakespeare, which means imagining the inexplicable, says that Shakespeare heard the secret summons and was sent along his proper path. The secret summons, the proper path, are what saints and geniuses hold in common. So do great writers, the semi-great, the good, the lesser, the dogged, the trudgers, and the merely anxious. All will discover that Paradise (everybody's future) is crisscrossed with hedges. Looking across a hedge to the green place where genius is consigned, we shall see them assembled, waiting to receive a collective reward if only they will agree on the source of the summons and the start of the proper path. The choir of voices floating back above the hedge probably will be singing, \u201cBon qu'a \u00e7a.\u201d for want of knowing.", "The Serpent and the Rainbow": "For example, in the northwest rain forests of Oregon there are a number of native species of hallucinogenic mushrooms. Those who go out into the forest deliberately intending to ingest these mushrooms generally experience a pleasant intoxication. Those who inadvertently consume them while foraging for edible mushrooms invariably end up in the poison unit of the nearest hospital. The mushroom itself has not changed. Every society, including our own, is moved by a fundamental quest for unity; a struggle to create order out of perceived disorder, integrity in the face of diversity, consistency in the face of anomaly. This vital urge to render coherent and intelligible models of the universe is at the root of all religion, philosophy, and, of course, science. What distinguishes scientific thinking from that of traditional and, as it often turns out, nonliterate cultures is the tendency of the latter to seek the shortest possible means to achieve total understanding of their world. The Death\u2019s essence is the severance from the mortal body of some elusive life-giving principle, and how a culture comes to understand or at least tolerate this inexorable separation to a great extent defines its mystical worldview Sometimes when one stands in the late afternoon light the body casts a double shadow, a dark core and then a lighter penumbra, faint like the halo that sometimes surrounds the full moon.

At clinical death, it returns immediately to God and once again becomes part of the great reservoir of energy that supports all life. But if the gros bon ange is undifferentiated energy, the ti bon ange is that part of the soul directly associated with the individual. As the gros bon ange provides each person with the power to act, it is the ti bon ange that molds the individual sentiments within each act. It is one\u2019s aura, and the source of all personality, character, and willpower. while the vodounist serves his gods, he also gives birth to them, and this is something that is never forgotten; as much as the spirit is the source of the flesh, so the flesh gives rise to the spirit. In place of opposition between the two, there is mutual dependence. Thus the regular arrival of the divine is not considered miraculous, but rather inevitable. Within this cosmic exchange, perhaps man\u2019s most critical contribution is the preservation of his own equilibrium, for without it the receptacle of the gods is placed in danger. The ideal form of man, therefore, is one of coherence, wherein all the sacred components of the individual find their proper place. Much more serious are the troubles that arise when the harmony of the spiritual components is broken. Here it is the source of the disorder, not its particular manifestation, that must be treated, As a form of medicine, it does not ignore the existence of pathogens, it simply comments that the pathogens are present in the environment at all times, and it asks why certain individuals succumb when they do. At the time Franz Boas was in the process of revolutionizing the field of anthropology. In an era when British social anthropology was still an explicit tool of imperialism, he rejected arbitrary notions of progress and evolutionary theories that invariably placed Western society at the top of a social ladder. Instead he championed the need to study cultures because of their inherent value. Every culture possessed a certain logic, he would say, and they appeared peculiar to the outsider only because he or she did not understand that logic. Someone of such wildness learns nothing from his elders. So he goes to the wild places to be among the leaves. Now he appears again among the living because leaves are not enough.\u201d", "Code version 2.0": "the form of the battle is clear: commerce and government working to change the infrastructure to make better control possible. Esther Dyson and John Perry Barlow, and Todd Lapin still inspire, Andrew Shapiro, David Shenk, and Steven Johnson \u201cWe reject: kings, presidents and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code.\u201d2 Liberty in cyberspace will not come from the absence of the state. Liberty there, as anywhere, will come from a state of a certain kind. We build a world where freedom can flourish not by removing from society any self-conscious control, but by setting it in a place where a particular kind of self-conscious control survives. We build liberty as our founders did, by setting society upon a certain constitution. I mean an architecture\u2014not just a legal text but a way of life\u2014that structures and constrains social and legal power, to the end of protecting fundamental values. Left to itself, cyberspace will become a perfect tool of control. the argument of this book is that the invisible hand of cyberspace is building an architecture that is quite the opposite of its architecture at its birth. This invisible hand, pushed by government and by commerce, is constructing an architecture that will perfect control and make highly efficient regulation possible. While once it seemed obvious and easy to declare the rise of a \u201dnetwork society\u201d in which individuals would realign themselves, empower themselves, and undermine traditional methods of social and cultural control, it seems clear that networked digital communication need not serve such liberating ends.5 This book is about the change from a cyberspace of anarchy to a cyberspace of control. When we see the path that cyberspace is on now\u2014an evolution I describe below in Part I\u2014we see that much of the \u201cliberty\u201d present at cyberspace\u2019s founding will be removed in its future. Values originally considered fundamental will not survive. As William Mitchell puts it, this code is cyberspace\u2019s \u201claw.\u201d6\u201cLex Informatica,\u201d as Joel Reidenberg first put it,7or better, \u201ccode is law.\u201d We can build, or architect, or code cyberspace to protect values that we believe are fundamental. Or we can build, or architect, or code cyberspace to allow those values to disappear. \u201cdetermines which people can access which digital objects . . . How such programming regulates human interactions . . . depends on the choices made.\u201d10 In speaking of a constitution in cyberspace we are simply asking: What values should be protected there? What values should be built into the space to encourage what forms of life? The \u201cvalues\u201d at stake here are of two sorts\u2014substantive and structural. There is much to be proud of in our history and traditions. But the government we now have is a failure. Nothing important should be trusted to its control, even though everything important is. Through extremism in copyright regulation, it is criminalizing the core creativity that this network could produce. What does it mean to live in a world where problems can be coded away? And when, in that world, should we code problems away, rather than learn to work them out, or punish those who cause them? Given the architecture of the Internet (at least as it was circa 1999), it doesn\u2019t really matter where in real space the server is. Access doesn\u2019t depend on geography. with the architecture of the Net as it originally was, life on the Net is less regulable than life off the Net. The network removed the most important constraint on speech in real space\u2014the separation of publisher from author. cyberspace is different because of the reach it allows. But it is also different because of the relative anonymity it permits. The Net enables lives that were previously impossible, or inconvenient, or uncommon. \u201cIs freedom inversely related to the efficiency of the available means of surveillance?\u201d Both private and public monitoring in the digital age, then, have the same salient feature: monitoring, or searching, can increase without increasing the burden on the individual searched. Both present a similar question: How should we think about this change? How should the protection the framers gave us be applied to a world the framers couldn\u2019t even imagine? \u201cRegulability\u201d is the capacity of a government to regulate behavior within its proper reach. To regulate well, you need to know (1) who someone is, (2) where they are, and (3) what they\u2019re doing. But because of the way the Internet was originally designed (and more on this below), there was no simple way to know (1) who someone is, (2) where they are, and (3) what they\u2019re doing. Thus, as life moved onto (this version of) the Internet, the regulability of that life decreased. The architecture of the space\u2014at least as it was\u2014rendered life in this space less regulable. There is regulation of behavior on the Internet and in cyberspace, but that regulation is imposed primarily through code. The differences There is regulation of behavior on the Internet and in cyberspace, but that regulation is imposed primarily through code. The differences in the regulations effected through code distinguish different parts of the Internet and cyberspace. In some places, life is fairly free; in other places, it is more controlled. And the difference between these spaces is simply a difference in the architectures of control\u2014that is, a difference in code. possible network designs. At one extreme we might place the Internet\u2014a network defined by a suite of protocols that are open and nonproprietary and that require no personal identification to be accessed and used. At the other extreme are traditional closed, proprietary networks, which grant access only to those with express authorization; control, When people say that the Internet is \u201cunregulable,\u201d which network are they describing? Because there is no simple way to know who someone is, where they come from, and what they\u2019re doing, there is no simple way to regulate how people behave on the Net. Architectures of control could be layered on top of the Net to \u201ccorrect\u201d or eliminate \u201cimperfections.\u201d And these architectures could, in other words, facilitate control.9 Architectures of control are possible; they could be added to the Internet that we already know. If they were added, that would radically change the character of the network. Architectures of control are possible; they could be added to the Internet that we already know. If they were added, that would radically change the character of the network. Whether these architectures should be added depends upon what we want to use the network for. The claim of this book is that there are sufficient interests to move the Net95 from a default of anonymity to a default of identification THEINVISIBLEMAN DOESN\u2019T FEAR THE STATE. HE KNOWS HIS NATURE PUTS HIM\u00a0 beyond its reach (unless he gets stupid, and of course, he always gets stupid). If you can\u2019t know who someone is, or where he is, or what he\u2019s doing, you can\u2019t regulate him. His behavior is as he wants it to be. There\u2019s little the state can do to change it. So too with the original Internet: Everyone If you can\u2019t know who someone is, or where he is, or what he\u2019s doing, you can\u2019t regulate him. His behavior is as he wants it to be. There\u2019s little the state can do to change it. The Net could be designed to reveal who someone is, where they are, and what they\u2019re doing. And if it were so designed, then the Net could become, as I will argue throughout this part, the most regulable space that man has ever known. In this chapter, I describe the changes that could\u2014and are\u2014pushing the Net from the unregulable space it was, to the perfectly regulable space it could be. These changes are not being architected by government. They are instead being demanded by users and deployed by commerce. They are not the product of some 1984-inspired conspiracy; they are the consequence of changes made for purely pragmatic, commercial ends. We each would be better off if we could more easily and confidently authenticate certain facts about us. Commerce, too, would certainly be better off with better technologies of authentication. Poor technologies begat fraud; fraud is an unproductive cost for business. If better technology could eliminate that cost, then prices could be lower and profits possibly higher. the regulability of life in real-space depends upon certain architectures of authentication. Identity and authentication in cyberspace and real space are in theory the same. In practice they are quite different. As I\u2019ve already said, the Internet is built from a suite of protocols referred to collectively as \u201cTCP/IP.\u201d At its core, the TCP/IP suite includes protocols for exchanging packets of data between two machines \u201con\u201d the Net. Once properly addressed, the packets are then sent across the Internet to their intended destination. Machines along the way (\u201crouters\u201d) look at the address to which the packet is sent, and depending upon an (increasingly complicated) algorithm, the machines decide to which machine the packet should be sent next. A packet could make many \u201chops\u201d between its start and its end. But as the network becomes faster and more robust, those many hops seem almost instantaneous. Rather than build into this network a complex set of functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network\u2014to the applications that run on the network, rather than the network\u2019s core. The core is kept as simple as possible. Rather than build into this network a complex set of functionality thought to be needed by every single application, this network philosophy pushes complexity to the edge of the network\u2014to the applications that run on the network, rather than the network\u2019s core. The core is kept as simple as possible. Thus if authentication about who is using the network is necessary, that functionality should be performed by an application connected to the network, not by the network itself. Or if content needs to be encrypted, that functionality should be performed by an application connected to the network, not by the network itself. the end-to-end principle.3It has been a core principle of the Internet\u2019s architecture, and, in my view, one of the most important reasons that the Internet produced the innovation and growth that it has enjoyed. While in real space\u2014and here is the important point\u2014anonymity has to be created, in cyberspace anonymity is the given. With that IP address, and the time you made your post, using \u201ca reverse DNS look-up,\u201d4it is simple to identify the Internet Service Provider that gave you access to the Internet. We are a people who leave our \u201cmouse droppings\u201d everywhere. Single Sign-on (SSO) technology. This technology allows someone to \u201csign-on\u201d to a network once, and then get access to a wide range of resources on that network without needing to authenticate again. in a federated system, I might authenticate myself to my university, but then I could move across any domain within the federation without authenticating again. A platform for authenticated identity would make anonymity much harder. \u201cnmap\u201d\u2014a program for network exploration or security auditing The Internet as it originally was gave everyone a \u201cRing of Gyges,\u201d the ring which, as Plato reports in The Republic, made Gyges the shepherd invisible. The dilemma for regulation in such a world is precisely the fear Plato had about this ring: With such a ring, \u201cno man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice.\u201d25 The Internet as it originally was gave everyone a \u201cRing of Gyges,\u201d the ring which, as Plato reports in The Republic, made Gyges the shepherd invisible. The dilemma for regulation in such a world is precisely the fear Plato had about this ring: With such a ring, \u201cno man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice.\u201d25 And if such a man did choose justice, even with the power of the ring, then \u201che would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another\u2019s faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.\u201d Technologies that make commerce more efficient are also technologies that make regulation simpler. In the United States, the identification of \u201can enemy\u201d\u2014terrorism\u2014has weakened the resolve to resist government action to make government more powerful and regulation more effective. The trick, then, is for the government to take steps that induce the development of an architecture that makes behavior more regulable Failing to comply with the rules of the United States government is not a foundation upon which to build a healthy, profitable company. All five of these examples address a behavior that the government wants to regulate, but which it cannot (easily) regulate directly. In all five, the government thus regulates that behavior indirectly by directly regulating technologies that affect that behavior. Those regulated technologies in turn influence or constrain the targeted behavior differently. They \u201cinfluence the development of code.\u201d23They are regulations of code that in turn make behavior more regulable. In a world where the code writers were the sort of people who governed the Internet Engineering Task Force29of a few years ago, the answer is probably no. The underpaid heroes who built the Net have ideological reasons to resist government\u2019s mandate. They were not likely to yield to its threats. Thus, they would provide an important check on the government\u2019s power over the architectures of cyberspace. Netscape or IBM was not about to build and sell software in violation of U.S. regulations. The United States has a fairly powerful threat against these two companies. As the techies predicted, regulation did not control the flow of bits. But it did quite substantially inhibit the development of software that would use these bits.30 The effect has been profound. Companies that were once bastions of unregulability are now becoming producers of technologies that facilitate regulation. The power of East Coast Code over West Coast Code has increased. When software was the product of hackers and individuals located outside of any institution of effective control (for example, the University of Illinois or MIT), East Coast Code could do little to control West Coast Code.34But as code has become the product of companies, the power of East Coast Code has increased. When commerce writes code, then code can be controlled, because commercial entities can be controlled. Thus, the power of East over West increases as West Coast A fundamental principle of bovinity is operating here and elsewhere. Tiny controls, consistently enforced, are enough to direct very large animals. The controls of a certificate-rich Internet are tiny, I agree. But we are large animals. I think it is as likely that the majority of people would resist these small but efficient regulators of the Net as it is that cows would resist wire fences. This is who we are, and this is why these regulations work. In May 2006, the Harvard Law Review gave Professor Jonathan Zittrain (hence \u201cZ-theory\u201d) 67 pages to explain \u201cThe Generative Internet.\u201d We have been as welcoming and joyous about the Net as the earthlings were about the aliens in Independence Day; we have accepted its growth in our lives without questioning its final effect. But at some point, we too will come to see a potential threat. We will see that cyberspace does not guarantee its own freedom but instead carries an extraordinary potential for control. And then we will ask: How should we respond? Too many miss how different architectures embed different values, and that only by selecting these different architectures\u2014these different codes\u2014can we establish and promote our values. If anything is certain, it is that an architecture of identity will develop on the Net\u2014and thereby fundamentally transform its regulability. But isn\u2019t it clear that government should do something to make this architecture consistent with important public values? If commerce is going to define the emerging architectures of cyberspace, isn\u2019t the role of government to ensure that those public values that are not in commerce\u2019s interest are also built into the architecture? Architecture is a kind of law: It determines what people can and cannot do. When commercial interests determine the architecture, they create a kind of privatized law. Politics is the process by which we reason about how things ought to be. in a powerful trilogy drawing together a movement in legal theory, Roberto Unger preached that \u201cit\u2019s all politics.\u201d44He As Bruce Ackerman puts it, we must ask of every exercise of power: Why? If code is law, then, as William Mitchell writes, \u201ccontrol of code is power\u201d: \u201cFor citizens of cyberspace, . . . code . . . is becoming a crucial focus of political contest. Who shall write that software that increasingly structures our daily lives?\u201d46As the world is now, code writers are increasingly lawmakers. They determine what the defaults of the Internet will be; whether privacy will be protected; the degree to which anonymity will be allowed; the extent to which access will be guaranteed. They are the ones who set its nature. Their decisions, now made in the interstices of how the Net is coded, define what the Net is. How the code regulates, who the code writers are, and who controls the code writers\u2014these are questions on which any practice of justice must focus in the age of cyberspace. The answers reveal how cyberspace is regulated. My claim in this part of the book is that cyberspace is regulated by its code, and that the code is changing. Its regulation is its code, and its code is changing. Our aim must be to understand this power and to ask whether it is properly exercised. As David Brin asks, \u201cIf we admire the Net, should not a burden of proof fall on those who would change the basic assumptions that brought it about in the first place?\u201d47 These \u201cbasic assumptions\u201d were grounded in liberty and openness. An invisible hand now threatens both. We need to understand how. Commerce has a purpose, and government can exploit that to its own end. It will, increasingly and more frequently, and when it does, the character of the Net will change. Cyberspace, by contrast, is not just about making life easier. It is about making life different, or perhaps better. 3However much one romanticizes the old days when the Net was a place for conversation and exchange, this is not its function for most of its users now. In real space, the law means you can be penalized for violating the \u201chigh/low\u201d rule. In Second Life, you simply can\u2019t violate the 15-meter rule. The rule is part of the code. The code controls how you are in Second Life. There isn\u2019t a choice about obeying the rule or not, any more than there\u2019s a choice about obeying gravity. So code is law here. That code/law enforces its control directly. Here again, the code expresses the law more effectively than the law in real space ever could. As Susan Crawford describes, \u201cThe miraculous growth of the Internet has in large part come from the nondiscrimination against higher levels. . . . Innovators at the application layer have been able to assume the continued stable existence of the lower layers.\u201d55 The network owner might not like the stuff being developed, but e2e disables the opportunity to block that development. End-to-end is a paradigm for technology that embeds values. Which architecture we encourage is a choice about which policy we encourage. This is true even in the context in which the Internet is not a \u201cplace\u201d\u2014even where, that is, it is \u201cjust\u201d a medium. The Audio Home Recording Act both taxed blank tapes slightly and regulated the code of digital reproduction technologies directly. In the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Congress banned the creation and distribution of technologies \u201cproduced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access\u201d to a copyrighted work, or \u201cprimarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner.\u201d the government directs an intermediary that has some power over code to change that code to effect a change in behavior. On Liberty. Published in 1859, this powerful argument for individual liberty and diversity of thought represents an important view of liberal and libertarian thinking in the second half of the nineteenth century. \u201cLibertarian,\u201d however, has a specific meaning for us. For most, it associates with arguments against government.1Government, in the modern libertarian\u2019s view, is the threat to liberty; private action is not. Thus, the good libertarian is focused on reducing government\u2019s power. Curb the excesses of government, the libertarian says, and you will ensure freedom for your society. Liberty, in Mill\u2019s view, was threatened as much by norms as by government, as much by stigma and intolerance as by the threat of state punishment. His objective was to argue against these private forces of coercion. His work was a defense against liberty-suppressing norms, because, in England at that time, these were the real threat to liberty Mill\u2019s method is important, and it should be our own as well. It asks, What is the threat to liberty, and how can we resist it? It is not limited to asking, What is the threat to liberty from government? It understands that more than government can threaten liberty, and that sometimes this something more can be private rather than state action. Mill was not concerned with the source of the threat to liberty. His concern was with liberty. rather than think of \u201cliberty\u2019s enemy\u201d in the abstract, we should focus upon a particular threat to liberty that might exist in a particular time and place. And this is especially true when we think about liberty in cyberspace. I believe that cyberspace creates a new threat to liberty, not new in the sense that no theorist had conceived of it before,4but new in the sense of newly urgent. We are coming to understand a newly powerful regulator in cyberspace. That regulator could be a significant threat to a wide range of liberties, and we don\u2019t yet understand how best to control it. rather than think of \u201cliberty\u2019s enemy\u201d in the abstract, we should focus upon a particular threat to liberty that might exist in a particular time and place.

We are coming to understand a newly powerful regulator in cyberspace. That regulator could be a significant threat to a wide range of liberties, and we don\u2019t yet understand how best to control it. This regulator is what I call \u201ccode\u201d\u2014the instructions embedded in the software or hardware that makes cyberspace what it is. My argument is not that there\u2019s only one threat to liberty, or that we should forget other, more traditional threats. It is instead that we must add one more increasingly salient threat to the list. And to see this new, salient threat, I believe we need a more general understanding of how regulation works\u2014one that focuses on more than the single influence of any one force such as government, norms, or the market, and instead integrates these factors into a single account. Laws, norms, the market, and architectures interact to build the environment that \u201cNetizens\u201d know. The code writer, as Ethan Katsh puts it, is the \u201carchitect.\u201d21 Architecture, laws, and customs maintain and represent whatever balance has been struck in real space. As we construct and inhabit cyberspace communities, we will have to make and maintain similar bargains\u2014though they will be embodied in software structures and electronic access controls rather than in architectural arrangements.20 Architecture, laws, and customs maintain and represent whatever balance has been struck in real space. As we construct and inhabit cyberspace communities, we will have to make and maintain similar bargains\u2014though they will be embodied in software structures and electronic access controls rather than in architectural arrangements As a sign above one of the portals at the 1933 Chicago World\u2019s Fair put it (though it was speaking of science): \u201cScience Explores: Technology Executes: Man Conforms.\u201d36 Law can change social norms as well, though much of our constitutional jurisprudence seems dedicated to forgetting just how.37Education is the most obvious example. 38Education is, in part at least, a process through which we indoctrinate children into certain norms of behavior\u2014we teach them how to \u201csay no\u201d to sex and drugs. We try to build within them a sense of what is correct. This sense then regulates them to the law\u2019s end. \u201clegal policy proposals unsupported by predictions of technological response are deeply incomplete.\u201d law functions in two very different ways.53 When its operation is direct, it tells individuals how to behave and threatens punishment if they deviate from that behavior. When its operation is indirect, it modifies one of the other structures of constraint. When we see regulation in this more general way, we can see more clearly how the unregulability of cyberspace is contingent. We get a stronger sense of how the state could intervene to make regulation work, and we should also get a sense of the increased dangers presented by this more expansive sense of regulation. In particular, we should have a stronger sense of the danger it presents to constitutional values. The next section considers one such threat. Indirection misdirects responsibility. When a government uses other structures of constraint to effect a constraint it could impose directly, it muddies the responsibility for that constraint and so undermines political accountability. If transparency is a value in constitutional government, indirection is its enemy. It confuses responsibility and hence confuses politics.56 worse than in the federalism context, the victim of the misrepresentation here does not even realize that the misrepresentation is a policy choice. The patient is unlikely to hear the doctor\u2019s statement as a political broadcast from the government; she is most likely to hear it as a medical opinion. Not only is there a confusion about who is responsible for the opinion expressed, but there is also confusion about whether it is an opinion at all. Rust v. Sullivan, the Court upheld the power of the government to bias the provision of family planning advice by forbidding doctors in \u201cgovernment-funded\u201d clinics from mentioning abortion as a method of family planning.50This is a regulation of social norms (within the social structure of medical care) to regulate behavior. The most New York stands for is the idea that states, as independent sovereigns deserving of special constitutional respect, cannot be co-opted to the federal government\u2019s ends\u2014that when the federal government has a program it wants to carry out, it must put its own name behind it. As awful as such provisions were, they had a certain integrity. They clearly stated their purpose and were transparent about the values they affirmed. No one could pretend that the segregation they effected was somehow an accidental by-product of decisions made elsewhere. So when the Court ended direct segregation, we should expect indirect segregation to emerge to replace it. The state has no right to hide its agenda. In a constitutional democracy its regulations should be public. And thus, one issue raised by the practice of indirect regulation is the general issue of publicity. Should the state be permitted to use nontransparent means when transparent means are available? THE INCREASING regulability of the Internet that we should expect. These are, as I described, changes in the architecture of the Net that will better enable government\u2019s control by making behavior more easily monitored\u2014or at least more traceable. These changes will emerge even if government does nothing. They are the by-product of changes made to enable e-commerce. But they will be cemented if (or when) the government recognizes just how it could make the network its tool. regulation by code can interfere with the ordinary democratic process by which we hold regulators accountable. The key criticism that I\u2019ve identified so far is transparency. Code-based regulation\u2014especially of people who are not themselves technically expert\u2014risks making regulation invisible. Controls are imposed for particular policy reasons, but people experience these controls as nature. And that experience, I suggested, could weaken democratic resolve. If code regulates, then in at least some critical contexts, the kind of code that regulates is critically important. If code regulates, then in at least some critical contexts, the kind of code that regulates is critically important. By \u201ckind\u201d I mean to distinguish between two types of code: open and closed. By \u201copen code\u201d I mean code (both software and hardware) whose functionality is transparent at least to one knowledgeable about the technology. By \u201cclosed code,\u201d I mean code (both software and hardware) whose functionality is opaque. One can guess what closed code is doing; and with enough opportunity to test, one might well reverse engineer it. But from the technology itself, there is no reasonable way to discern what the functionality of the technology is. What most call the\u201copen source software movement,\u201d but which I, following Richard Stallman, call the \u201cfree software movement,\u201d argues (in my view at least) that there are fundamental values of freedom that demand that software be developed as free software. open code is a constraint on state power, and second, that in at least some cases, code must, in the relevant sense, be \u201copen.\u201d where transparency of government action matters, so too should the kind of code it uses. This is not the claim that all government code should be public. I believe there are legitimate areas within which the government can act secretly. More particularly, where transparency would interfere with the function itself, then there\u2019s a good argument against transparency. But there were very limited ways in which a possible criminal suspect could more effectively evade the surveillance of Carnivore just because its code was open. You control the machines; you won\u2019t show us how they work; and you promise a particular result in the election. Is there any doubt people would be suspicious?7 in certain contexts at least, the transparency of open code should be a requirement. How does open code affect regulability the Internet is constructed by a set of protocols together referred to as TCP/IP. The TCP/IP suite includes a large number of protocols that feed different \u201clayers\u201d of the network. \u201cmost descriptions of TCP/IP define three to five functional levels in the protocol architecture.\u201d In my view, it is simplest to describe four functional layers in a TCP/IP architecture.9From the bottom of the stack up, we can call these the data link, network, transport, and application layers.10 Ontop of these three layers is the application layer of the Internet. Here protocols \u201cproliferate.\u201d11These include the most familiar network application protocols, such as FTP (file transfer protocol, a protocol for transferring files), SMTP (simple mail transport protocol, a protocol for transferring mail), and HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol, a protocol to publish and read hypertext documents across the Web). These four layers of protocols are \u201cthe Internet.\u201d Building on simple blocks, the system makes possible an extraordinary range of interaction. It is perhaps not quite as amazing as nature\u2014think of DNA\u2014but it is built on the same principle: keep the elements simple, and the compounds will astound. When I speak about regulating the code, I\u2019m not talking about changing these core TCP/IP protocols. (Though in principle, of course, they could be regulated, and others have suggested that they should be.)13In my view these components of the network are fixed. If you required them to be different, you\u2019d break the Internet. Thus rather than imagining the government changing the core, the question I want to consider is how the government might either (1) complement the core with technology that adds regulability, or (2) regulates applications that connect to the core. Both will be important, but my focus is on the code that plugs into the Internet. I will call that code the \u201capplication space\u201d of the Internet. 16This openness was responsible for much of the early Net\u2019s growth. Others could explore how a program was implemented and learn from that example how better to implement the protocol in the future. Openness\u2014not property or contract but free code and access\u2014created the boom that gave birth to the Internet that we now know. This is the Free Software Foundation\u2019s General Public License (GPL), which requires that any code licensed with GPL (as GNU/Linux is) keep its source free. GNU/Linux was developed by an extraordinary collection of hackers worldwide only because its code was open for others to work on. Its code, in other words, sits in the commons.22Anyone can take it and use it as she wishes. Anyone can take it and come to understand how it works. The code of GNU/Linux is like a research program whose results are always published for others to see. Everything is public; anyone, without having to seek the permission of anyone else, may join the project. \u201cTrusted Computing\u201d creates another threat to the open code ecology. Launched as a response to virus and security threats within a networked environment, the key technical feature of \u201ctrusted computing\u201d is that the platform blocks programs that are not cryptographically signed or verified by the platform. For example, if you want to run a program on your computer, your computer would first verify that the program is certified by one of the authorities recognized by the computer operating system, and \u201cincorporat[ing] hardware and software . . . security standards approved by the content providers themselves.\u201d23If it isn\u2019t, the program wouldn\u2019t run. Open code projects\u2014whether free software or open source software projects\u2014 share the feature that the knowledge necessary to replicate the project is intended always to be available to others. There is no effort, through law or technology, for the developer of an open code project to make that development exclusive. And, more importantly, the capacity to replicate and redirect the evolution of a project provided in its most efficient form is also always preserved. The code is regulable only because the code writers can be controlled. Regulable code is closed code. Assume Netscape really did control the standards for SSL and in theory could modify the code to enable French spying. Would that mean that Netscape could comply with the French demand? No. Technically, it could comply by modifying the code of Netscape Communicator and then posting a new module that enabled hacking by a government. But because Netscape (or more generally, the Mozilla project) is open source, anyone is free to build a competing module that would replace the Frenchified SSL module. That module would compete with other modules. The module that wins would be the one users wanted. Users don\u2019t typically want a module that enables spying by a government. The same idea liberates open code. The government\u2019s rules are rules only to the extent that they impose restrictions that adopters would want. The government may coordinate standards (like \u201cdrive on the right\u201d), but it certainly cannot impose standards that constrain users in ways they do not want to be constrained. This architecture, then, is an important check on the government\u2019s regulatory power. Open code means open control\u2014there is control, but the user is aware of it.25 Closed code functions differently. With closed code, users cannot easily modify the control that the code comes packaged with. Hackers and very sophisticated programmers may be able to do so, but most users would not know which parts were required and which parts were not. Or more precisely, users would not be able to see the parts required and the parts not required because the source code does not come bundled with closed code. Closed code is the propagandist\u2019s best strategy\u2014not a separate chapter that the user can ignore, but a persistent and unrecognized influence that tilts the story in the direction the propagandist wants. there is\u2014and legally can be\u2014a community of developers who modify open code, but there is not\u2014or legally cannot be\u2014a community of developers who modify closed code, at least without the owner\u2019s permission. That culture of developers is the critical mechanism that creates the independence within open code. Without that culture, there\u2019d be little real difference between the regulability of open and closed code. Government\u2019s power to regulate code, to make behavior within the code regulable, depends in part on the character of the code. Open code is less regulable than closed code; to the extent that code becomes open, government\u2019s power is reduced. imagine for the moment that the recording industry is successful in driving out of business every business that supports P2P filesharing. The industry won\u2019t be successful in driving P2P out of existence. This is because open code has enabled noncommercial actors to sustain the infrastructure of P2P sharing, without the commercial infrastructure. For some, the objective is to build code that disables any possible governmental control. That is not my objective. I certainly believe that government must be constrained, and I endorse the constraints that open code imposes, but it is not my objective to disable government generally. As I\u2019ve argued already, and as the next part makes plain, some values can be achieved only if government intervenes. Government has a role, even if not as substantial a role as it would wish. We need to understand this role, as well as how our values might be advanced in the context of the Web. Regulability is conditional on the character of the code, and open code changes that character. It is a limit on government\u2019s power to regulate\u2014not necessarily by defeating the power to regulate, but by changing it. In my view, the most important lesson about law in cyberspace is the need for law to account for the regulatory effect of code. Brandeis acknowledged that the Fourth Amendment, as originally written, applied only to trespass.14But it did so, he argued, because when it was written trespass was the technology for invading privacy. That was the framers\u2019 presupposition, but that presupposition had now changed. Given this change, Brandeis argued, it was the Court\u2019s responsibility to read the amendment in a way that preserved its meaning, changed circumstances notwithstanding. The aim must be to translate the original protections into a context in which the technology for invading privacy had changed.15This would be done, Brandeis argued, by applying the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection to invasions that were not themselves trespasses. If there is a justice who deserves cyberspace\u2019s praise, if there is a Supreme Court opinion that should be the model for cyber activists in the future, if there is a first chapter in the fight to protect cyberspace, it is this justice, this opinion, and this case. Brandeis gave us a model for reading the Constitution to preserve its meaning, and its values, across time and context. It is a method that recognizes what has changed and accommodates that change to preserve something of what the framers originally gave us. It is a method that translates the Constitution\u2019s meaning across fundamentally different contexts\u2014whether they are as temporally distant as we are from the framers or as distant as cyberspace is from real space. regime that made privacy hang on property did not protect privacy to the same degree that the framers had intended. Justice Stewart in Katz sought to remedy that by linking the Fourth Amendment to a more direct protection of privacy. The link was the idea of \u201ca reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d The core value, Stewart wrote, was the protection of \u201cpeople, not places.\u201d21Hence, the core technique should be to protect people where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Where this is the case, the government cannot invade that space without satisfying the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. Where circumstances have changed to nullify the protections of some original right, the Court should adopt a reading of the Constitution that restores that right. Professor Tribe describes an example in a founding article in the law of cyberspace, \u201cThe Constitution in Cyberspace.\u201d24Tribe sketches a method of reading the Constitution in cyberspace that aims to make the Constitution \u201ctechnologically neutral.\u201d The constitutional discourse of our present Congress is far below the level at which it must be to address the questions about constitutional values that will be raised by cyberspace. norms about copyrighted content also evolved. But the single, defining feature of these norms can perhaps be summarized like this: that a consumer could do with the copyrighted content that he legally owned anything he wanted to do, without ever triggering the law of copyright. Built into its scattershot of ideas is one that is crucial to its approach but fundamentally incorrect\u2014the idea that the nature of cyberspace is anarchy. Built into its scattershot of ideas is one that is crucial to its approach but fundamentally incorrect\u2014the idea that the nature of cyberspace is anarchy. The White Paper promises to strengthen law in every area it can. But it approaches the question like a ship battening down for a storm: Whatever happens, the threat to copyright is real, damage will be done, and the best we can do is ride it out. We are not entering a time when copyright is more threatened than it is in real space. We are instead entering a time when copyright is more effectively protected than at any time since Gutenberg. The power to regulate access to and use of copyrighted material is about to be perfected. the real question for law is not, how can law aid in that protection? but rather, is the protection too great? the lesson in the future will be that copyright is protected far too well. The problem will center not on copy-right but on copy-duty\u2014the duty of owners of protected property to make that property accessible. But a more sophisticated system of rights could be built into the Net\u2014 not into a different Net, but on top of the existing Net. This system would function by discriminating in the intercourse it has with other systems. A system that controlled access in this more fine-grained way would grant access to its resources only to another system that controlled access in the same way. A hierarchy of systems would develop, and copyrighted material would be traded only among systems that properly controlled access. Private law creates private rights to the extent that these private rights serve some collective good. If a private right is harmful to a collective good, then the state has no reason to create it. The state\u2019s interests are general, not particular. It has a reason to create rights when those rights serve a common, rather than particular, end. The institution of private property is an application of this point. The state has an interest in defining rights to private property because private property helps produce a general, and powerful, prosperity. It is a system for ordering economic relations that greatly benefits all members of society. No other system that we have yet devised better orders economic relations. In countless ways, the system of property we call \u201cprivate property\u201d is a system that balances exclusive control by the individual against certain common state ends. When the latter conflict with the former, it is the former that yields. The balance of rights with intellectual property differs from the balance with ordinary real or personal property. \u201cInformation,\u201d as Boyle puts it, \u201cis different.\u201d 26An unavoidable feature of intellectual property is that its consumption, as the economists like to put it, is \u201cnonrivalrous Ideas, at their core, can be shared with no reduction in the amount the \u201cowner\u201d can consume. If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possess the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lites his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density at any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.27 once they are divulged, ideas are not \u201crivalrous.\u201d Jefferson believes that the act of divulging/sharing has made ideas both nonexcludable and nonrivalrous, and that there is little that man can do to change this fact.29 It does not follow, however, that there is no need for property rights over expressions or inventions.30Just because you can have what I have without lessening what I have does not mean that the state has no reason to create rights over ideas, or over the expression of ideas. With ordinary property, the law must both create an incentive to produce and protect the right of possession; with intellectual property, the law need only create the incentive to produce. While we protect real and personal property to protect the owner from harm and give the owner an incentive, we protect intellectual property to ensure that we create a sufficient incentive to produce it. \u201cSufficient incentive,\u201d however, is something less than \u201cperfect control.\u201d And in turn we can say that the ideal protections of intellectual property law are something less than the ideal protections for ordinary or real property. The Constitution\u2019s protection for intellectual property then is fundamentally different from its protection of ordinary property. Intellectual property rights are a monopoly that the state gives to producers of intellectual property in exchange for their production of it. After a limited time, the product of their work becomes the public\u2019s to use as it wants. This is Communism at the core of our Constitution\u2019s protection of intellectual property. This \u201cproperty\u201d is not property in the ordinary sense of that term. Increasing intellectual property\u2019s protection is not guaranteed to \u201cpromote the progress of science and useful arts\u201d\u2014indeed, often doing so will stifle it. where contract and property, however grounded in private action, give a private person an entitlement where contract and property, however grounded in private action, give a private person an entitlement to the state. Shamans, Software, and Spleens. 1the problems of privacy and copyright are exactly the same. With both, there\u2019s a bit of \u201cour\u201d data that \u201cwe\u2019ve\u201d lost control over. In the case of copyright, it is the data constituting a copy of our copyrighted work; in the case of privacy, it is the data representing some fact about us. In both cases, the Internet has produced this loss of control: with copyright, because the technology enables perfect and free copies of content; with privacy, as we\u2019ll see in this chapter, because the technology enables perpetual and cheap monitoring of behavior. In both cases, the question policy makers should ask is what mix of law and technology might restore the proper level of control. That level must balance private and public interests: With copyright, the balance is as I described in the last chapter; with privacy, it is as we\u2019ll explore in this chapter. In all these cases, technologies designed either without monitoring as their aim or with just limited monitoring as their capacity have now become expert technologies for monitoring. The aggregate of these technologies produces an extraordinary range of searchable data. And, more importantly, as these technologies mature, there will be essentially no way for anyone living within ordinary society to escape this monitoring. Monitoring to produce searchable data will become the default architecture for public space, as standard as street lights. While the ends of the government in 1984 were certainly vastly more evil than anything our government would ever pursue, it is interesting to note just how inefficient, relative to the current range of technologies, Orwell\u2019s technologies were. The central device was a \u201ctelescreen\u201d that both broadcasted content and monitored behavior on the other side. But the great virtue of the telescreen was that you knew what it, in principle, could see. Winston knew where to hide, because the perspective of the telescreen was transparent.12It was easy to know what it couldn\u2019t see, and hence easy to know where to do the stuff you didn\u2019t want it to see. That\u2019s not the world we live in today. You can\u2019t know whether your search on the Internet is being monitored. You don\u2019t know whether a camera is trying to identify who you are. Your telephone doesn\u2019t make funny clicks as the NSA listens in. Your e-mail doesn\u2019t report when some bot has searched it. The technologies of today have none of the integrity of the technologies of 1984. None are decent enough to let you know when your life is being recorded. The question for us, then, is what limits there should be\u2014in the name of \u201cprivacy\u201d\u2014on the ability to surveil these activities. \u201cDigital surveillance\u201d is the process by which some form of human activity is analyzed by a computer according to some specified rule. \u2014\u201cI frankly doubt . . . whether the fiercely proud men who adopted our Fourth Amendment would have allowed themselves to be subjected, on mere suspicion of being armed and dangerous, to such indignity.\u201d16 A third conception of privacy is about neither preserving dignity nor minimizing intrusion. It is instead substantive\u2014privacy as a way to constrain the power of the state to regulate. Here the work of William Stuntz is a guide.17 Stuntz argues that the real purpose of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments is to make some types of regulation too difficult by making the evidence needed to prosecute such violations effectively impossible to gather. When their world differs from ours in a way that reveals a choice they did not have to make, then we need to make that choice. What power should the government have to surveil our activities, at least when those activities are in public? That\u2019s the special question raised by cyberspace: What limits on \u201cdigital surveillance\u201d should there be? what presumptive controls we should have over the data that we reveal to others. when you go out in public, when you make transactions there or send material there, you give up any right to privacy. Others now have the right to collect data about your public behavior and do with it what suits them. One lesson of the story is the burden of these monitored facts. The burden is on you, the monitored, first to establish your innocence, and second to assure all who might see these ambiguous facts that you are innocent \u201cAccountable\u201d is a benign term only so long as we have confidence in the community doing the accounting. When we live in multiple communities, accountability becomes a way for one community to impose its view of propriety on another. Because we do not live in a single community, we do not live by a single set of values. And perfect accountability can only undermine this mix of values 26Oscar Gandy calls this the \u201cpanoptic sort\u201d\u2014a vast structure for collecting data and discriminating on the basis of that data\u2014and it is this discrimination, he says, that ought to concern us.27 profiles will begin to normalize the population from which the norm is drawn. The observing will affect the observed. The system watches what you do; it fits you into a pattern; the pattern is then fed back to you in the form of options set by the pattern; the options reinforce the pattern; the cycle begins again. there is no single solution to policy problems on the Internet. Every solution requires a mix of at least two modalities. And in the balance of this chapter, my aim is to describe a mix for each of these two threats to privacy. Anonymity in this sense simply means non-traceability. Tools that enable this sort of non-traceability make it possible for an individual to send a message without the content of that message being traced to the sender. Cluttering the web with incomprehensible words will not empower consumers to make useful choices as they surf the Web. The architecture must enable machine-to-machine negotiations about privacy so that individuals can instruct their machines about the privacy they want to protect. More than government constrains speech, and more than government protects it. the Net is changing from free to controlled space. If 20Today there\u2019s a way to ensure that the government never has a compelling interest in asking a court to suppress publication. If the New York Times wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers today, it could ensure that the papers had been previously published simply by leaking them to a USENET newsgroup, or one of a million blogs. More quickly than its own newspaper is distributed, the papers would then be published in millions of places across the world. The need for the constitutional protection would be erased, because the architecture of the system gives anyone the power to publish quickly and anonymously. In a world where everyone can publish, it is very hard to know what to believe. Publishers are also editors, and editors make decisions about what to publish\u2014decisions that ordinarily are driven at least in part by the question, is it true? 57We should not design for the most efficient system of censoring\u2014or at least, we should not do this in a way that allows invisible upstream filtering. Nor should we opt for perfect filtering so long as the tendency worldwide is to overfilter speech. If there is speech the government has an interest in controlling, then let that control be obvious to the users. A political response is possible only when regulation is transparent. The law is a tool to change incentives, It is instead a choice that we must make: Whether the values of free speech restrict this radical increase in the scope of copyright\u2019s regulation. How much control should we allow over information, and by whom should this control be exercised The aim in all three contexts is to work against centralized structures of choice. In the context of filtering, however, the aim is to work against structures that are too individualized as well. I do not intend to. In my view, our tradition reveals at least an ambiguity about how far constitutional values are to extend. In a world where only governments are regulators, keeping the Constitution\u2019s authority limited to state action makes some sense. But when the modalities of regulation are multiplied, there is no reason to ignore the reach of constitutional values. Our framers made no choice about this; there is no reason why regulation through code cannot be informed by constitutional values. No argument has been made for why this part of our life should be cut off from the limitations and protections traditionally provided by the Constitution. To understand the power a government might have, we must understand the architectures within which it governs. To understand a state\u2019s power to regulate we must ask: How well does its infrastructure support regulation? These are all democracy-like. But they are not democracy. Democracy is the practice of the people choosing the rules that will govern a particular place. And with the exception of Wikipedia, and \u201cA Tale in the Desert,\u201d there are very few major Internet or cyberspace institutions that run by the rule of the people. David Post and his sometime coauthor David Johnson.11 Post\u2019s article \u201cAnarchy, State, and the Internet\u201d best sets the stage. The world of cyberspace, he argues, is comprised by these rule-sets. Individuals will choose to enter one rule-set or another. As rule-sets compete for our attention, the world of cyberspace will come to be defined by this competition of merchant-sovereigns for customers. Because competitive pressure is greater in cyberspace, governments and other propagators of rule-sets must behave like firms in a competitive market. Courts will need to recognize that virtual worlds are jurisdictions separate from our own, with their own distinctive community norms, laws, and rights. While cyborg inhabitants will demand that these rights be recognized by real-world courts and virtual-world wizards, they will need to arrive at these rights themselves within the context of the virtual worlds. Cyberspace is an international community; there are constitutional questions for it to answer; and we cannot simply stand back from this international space and say that these questions are local issues. We put into the world an architecture thatfacilitated extraordinarily free speech and extraordinary privacy; that enabled secure communications through a protocol that permitted encryption; and that encouraged free communications through a protocol that resisted censorship. That was the speech architecture that the Net gave the world\u2014that we gave the world. Now we are changing that architecture. We are enabling commerce in a way we did not before; we are contemplating the regulation of encryption; we are facilitating identity and content control. We are remaking the values of the Net, and the question is: Can we commit ourselves to neutrality in this reconstruction of the architecture of the Net? I don\u2019t think that we can. Or should. Or will. We can no more stand neutral on the question of whether the Net should enable centralized control of speech than Americans could stand neutral on the question of slavery in 1861. We should understand that we are part of a worldwide political battle; that we have views about what rights should be guaranteed to all humans, regardless of their nationality; and that we should be ready to press these views in this new political space opened up by the Net. I have argued that we should understand the code in cyberspace to be its own sort of regulatory regime, and that this code can sometimes be in competition with the law\u2019s regulatory regime. For example, we saw how copyright law could be inconsistent with the regulatory regime of trusted systems. My argument is that we should understand these to be two regulatory regimes in competition with each other. We need a way to choose between them. We need a way to decide which should prevail. Law, at least as it regulates international relations, is the product of extended negotiations. Countries must come to an agreement about how law will regulate and about any norms that they will impose on private ordering. As their work relates to cyberspace in particular, this agreement is quite significant. It will require the nations of the world to come to a common understanding about this space and to develop a common strategy for dealing with its regulation. There will be no nation that has no speech that it wishes to regulate on the Internet. Every nation will have something it wants to control. Those things, however, will be different, nation to nation. Yahoo!\u2019s arguments were premised on the 1990s vision of a borderless Internet. Half a decade later, this vision is fast being replaced by the reality of an Internet that is splitting apart and reflecting national borders. Far from flattening the world, the Internet is in many ways conforming to local conditions.12 Whenever anyone is in cyberspace, she is also here, in real space. Whenever one is subject to the norms of a cyberspace community, one is also living within a community in real space. You are always in both places if you are there, and the norms of both places apply. The problem for law is to work out how the norms of the two communities are to apply given that the subject to whom they apply may be in both places at once. As Edward Castronova writes,\u201csynthetic worlds are becoming important because events inside them can have effects outside them.\u201d 21The ideal rules for individuals may not necessarily be the ideal rules for institutions. The rules of copyright need to be reformed to make them better suited to a world where individuals are publishers. Jessica Litman makes an analogous point in her work on copyright.20For much of the last century, Litman argues, copyright has worked fairly well as a compromise between publishers and authors. It is a law that has largely been applied to institutions. Individuals were essentially outside copyright\u2019s purview since individuals didn\u2019t really \u201cpublish.\u201d At the founding ordinary people were not routinely living in multiple noncoordinating jurisdictions. This is something new. Perhaps no single document better reflects an ideal that was dominant on the network a decade ago. Whatever rule governed \u201cour bodies,\u201d no government could govern the \u201cvirtual selves\u201d that would live in this space. Barlow declared these \u201cvirtual selves\u201d \u201cimmune\u201d from real space sovereigns. Realspace sovereigns would be lost if they tried to exercise control here. The reasons Barlow\u2019s ideals were not going to be realized might be obvious in retrospect, but they weren\u2019t well recognized at the time. Laws are enacted as a result of political action; likewise they can be stopped only by political action. Ideas, or beautiful rhetoric, aren\u2019t political action. On Barlow\u2019s side, there had to be political action. But political action is just what the Net wasn\u2019t ready for. Governments,\u201d Geist writes, are \u201cunwilling to concede that national laws are limited to national borders, [and] are increasingly turning to explicitly extra-territorial legislation.\u201d26 The United States has a view of proper network behavior. It has asserted the right to enforce that view extraterritorially, and it enforces its rule against citizens from around the world whether or not the U.S. rule conflicts with a local rule. The FTC, for example, is \u201cvested with responsibility for enforcing [the Child Online Privacy Protection Act],\u201d Geist writes, and \u201cits rule-making guidance leaves no doubt that such sites are expected to comply with the statute in their privacy practices toward children.\u201d27So my view is that citizens of any democracy should have the freedom to choose what speech they consume. But I would prefer they earn that freedom by demanding it through democratic means than that a technological trick give it to them for free. When it becomes easy or cheap to regulate, however, this contingent liberty is at risk. We can expect more regulation. In these cases, if we want to preserve liberty, we will need to develop affirmative arguments for it. We will need these affirmative arguments to prevent identity-based regulation of the Net. As I explain in the balance of this book, there is both a surprisingly great desire for nations to embrace regimes that facilitate jurisdiction-specific regulation and a significant reason why the costs of regulation are likely to fall. We should expect, then, that there will be more such regulation. Soon. The effect, in short, would be to zone cyberspace based on the qualifications carried by individual users. It would enable a degree of control of cyberspace that few have ever imagined. Cyberspace would go from being an unregulable space to, depending on the depth of the certificates, the most regulable space imaginable. THERE ARE CHOICES THAT WILL DETERMINE HOW CYBERSPACE IS. BUT,IN MY VIEW, we Americans are disabled from making those choices. We are disabled for three very different reasons. The first is tied to the limits we place on courts; the second to the limits we have realized in legislatures; and the third to the limits in our thinking about code. We live in the shadow of the Supreme Court of Chief Justice Earl Warren. Many people think (but I am not one of this crowd) that his was a wildly activist court, that it \u201cmade up\u201d constitutional law and imposed its own \u201cpersonal values\u201d onto the political and legal system. Many viewed the Rehnquist Court as providing a balance to this activism of old. I think this view is wrong. The Warren Court was not \u201cactivist\u201d in any sense inconsistent with a principle of interpretive fidelity, and the Rehnquist Court was no less activist in that sense than the Warren Court. The question, however, is not what was true; the question is what people believe. What we believe is that the past was marked by activism, and that this activism was wrong. 14When the very foundations of a judgment are seen to be fundamentally contested, and when there is no reason to believe that the Constitution takes a position on this contest, then enforcing a particular outcome of translation will appear, in that context, political By striking down Congress\u2019s efforts to zone cyberspace, the courts were not telling us what cyberspace is but what it should be. They were making, not finding, the nature of cyberspace; their decisions are in part responsible for what cyberspace will become. To crack through lobbyism, you need a way to get the attention of members of Congress. But until the system is changed, the only way to get their attention is money. This is the cycle. Its results for democracy are vicious. OurCongress sees only what a small set want them to see. And what they see often has no obvious connection to the truth. If there is a decision to be made about how cyberspace will grow, then that decision will be made. The only question is by whom. We can stand by and do nothing as these choices are made\u2014by others, by those who will not simply stand by. Or we can try to imagine a world where choice can again be made collectively and responsibly. In cases where translation is not so simple (cases that have latent ambiguities), judges, especially lower court judges, have a different role. In these cases, judges should kvetch. They should talk about the questions these changes raise, and they should identify the competing values at stake. Even if the decision they must adopt in a particular case is deferential or passive, it should be deferential in protest. These cases may well be a place for prudence, but to justify their passivity and compensate for allowing rights claims to fail, judges should raise before the legal culture the conflict presented by them. Hard cases need not make bad law, but neither should they be treated as if they are easy. Guido Calabresi, a professor at the time who is now a judge.2 Brutally simplified, the idea is this: When the Supreme Court confronts issues that present open, yet fundamental questions of value, it should be open about the conflict and acknowledge that it is not plainly resolved by the Constitution. But the Court should nonetheless proceed to resolve it in the way most likely to induce democratic review of the resolution. If the resolution induces the proper review, the Court should let stand the results of that review. The most the Court should do in such cases is ensure that democracy has its say; its job is not to substitute its values for the views of democrats. The law presently does not do this. Indeed, as Mark Lemley and David O\u2019Brien argue, the existing structure of copyright protection for software tends to push the development of software away from a modular structure.5 The law prefers opaque to transparent code; it constructs incentives to hide code rather than to make its functionality obvious. power constrained by reason. When it works, it does something to the people who experience this persuasion. Some, for the first time in their lives, see power constrained by reason.

The Pirate Party is a political party which has made inroads in both Europe and Australia (and claims a very weak base in North America).

The inability to whisper means there is no longer any speech that is truly free of coercion, real or implied.

The story line or plot in nonfiction consists of the twists and turns of a thought process working itself out. This is certainly true for the essay, but it is also true, I think, for classic nonfiction in general, be it Thucydides or Pascal or Carlyle, which follows an organizing principle that can be summarized as \u201ctracking the consciousness of the author.\u201d What makes me want to keep reading a nonfiction text is the encounter with a surprising, well-stocked mind as it takes on the challenge of the next sentence, paragraph, and thematic problem it has set for itself. The other element that keeps me reading nonfiction happily is an evolved, entertaining, elegant, or at least highly intentional literary style. The pressure of style should be brought to bear on every passage. \u201cConsciousness plus style equals good nonfiction\u201d is one way of stating the formula. For me, the great adventure in reading nonfiction is to follow, as I say, a really interesting, unpredictable mind struggling to entangle and disentangle itself in a thorny problem, or even a frivolous problem that is made complex through engagement with a sophisticated mind. In my own writing I am trying to say, among other things, \u201cThis is my consciousness, now don\u2019t feel so guilty about yours. If you have perverse, curmudgeonly, conflicted, antisocial thoughts, know that others have them too.\u201d There have been times in my life when I\u2019ve actually tried to promote a passionate obsession with some person or idea, because it seemed like a solution to feeling at loose ends, and in the midst of trying to obsess, I would start to giggle, as if to say, \u201cWho am I kidding?\u201d The second problem with obsession is that it tends to go nowhere. Maybe obsession is a tool better suited for fiction; we nonfiction writers don\u2019t need it. Maybe obsession is a tool better suited for fiction; we nonfiction writers don\u2019t need it. Then what is needed to generate nonfiction? I would say curiosity. It may sound more tepid than obsession or passion, but it is vastly more dependable in the long run.

It offered a pretext and a structure for me to follow out my interests in a dozen different directions. This formula of curiosity-driven research plus personal voice is one of the most prevalent modes in today\u2019s successful nonfiction, Not obsession but curiosity. It is my underlying conviction that nonfiction as a practice tends toward reason, calm, insight, order. This temperate, rational inclination is not such a bad thing, but we nonfiction writers sometimes feel guilty about it and want to heat up the form, make it more irrational We may not ever be in possession of the truth, but at least as nonfiction writers we can try to be as honest as our courage permits. Honest to the world of facts outside ourselves, honest in reporting what we actually felt and did, and finally, honest about our own confusions and doubts. The challenge faced by the nonfiction writer is to take something that actually happened, to herself or to others, and try to render it as honestly and compellingly as possible. I do not think we need apply the strictest journalistic standards of factual accuracy to all literary nonfiction. the \u201chypnotic\u201d state, I believe, represents the desired condition when people speak about nonfiction reading like fiction. \u201cDon\u2019t invent, remember.\u201d even the barest I holds a whisper of promised engagement and can suggest a caress in the midst of more stolid language. What it doesn\u2019t do, however, is give us a clear picture of who is speaking. The art of characterization comes down to establishing a pattern of habits and actions for the person you are writing about and introducing variations into the system. In this respect, building a character is a pedagogic model, because you are teaching the reader what to expect. So how do you turn yourself into a character? First of all, you need to have\u2014or acquire\u2014some distance from yourself. The point is to begin to take inventory of yourself so that you can present that self to the reader as a specific, legible character. A good place to start is your quirks. These are the idiosyncrasies, stubborn tics, antisocial mannerisms, and so on that set you apart from the majority. we know\u2014that underneath it all we are common as dirt. But we may still need to maximize that pitiful set of quirks, those small differences that seem to set us apart from others, and project them theatrically, the way actors work with singularities in their physical appearance or vocal texture. In order to turn ourselves into characters, we need to dramatize ourselves. I don\u2019t mean inventing or adding colorful traits that aren\u2019t truly ours; I mean positioning those that are already in us under the most clearly focused, sharply defined light. It\u2019s a subtractive process: you need to cut away the inessentials and highlight just those features in your personality that most quickly characterize you, preferably those that lead to the most intense contradictions and ambivalences. What gives personal writing dynamism is the need to work out some problem, especially a problem that is not easily resolved. If you are serenely unconflicted when you first sit down to write, you may find yourself running out of steam. If you take on a problem that is too philosophically large or historically convoluted, you may choke on the details and give up. I am inclined to think that what stands in the way of most personal writing is not technique but psychology: what\u2019s needed is the emotional preparedness and the generosity, if you will, to be honest and open to exposure. the personal writer must be like a journalist, who respects the obligation to get in the basic orienting facts\u2014 The proper alternative to self-dislike is not being pleased with oneself\u2014a smug complacency that comes across as equally distasteful\u2014but being curious about oneself. Such self-curiosity (of which Montaigne was the fountainhead and greatest exemplar) can only grow out of that detachment or distance from oneself about which I spoke earlier. I may be very tired of myself in everyday life, but once I start narrating a situation or set of ideas on the page, I begin to see my I in a comic light, and I maneuver him so that he will best amuse the reader. There is also considerable character dimensionality to be derived from expressing your opinions, prejudices, half-baked ideas, etc., provided you are willing to analyze the flaws in your thinking and to consider arguments against your fixations and not be too solemn about it all. Nonfiction writing thrives on daring, darting, subjective flights of thought. You must get in the habit of inviting, not censoring, the most far-fetched, mischievous notions, because even if they prove cockeyed, they may point to an element of truth that would otherwise be inaccessible. There are hard choices to be made when a person is put under pressure, and it is in having made the wrong choice, curiously enough, that we are made all the more aware of our free will and humanity. In writing memoir, the trick, it seems to me, is to establish a double perspective that will allow the reader to participate vicariously in the experience as it was lived (the child\u2019s confusions and misapprehensions, say), while benefiting from the sophisticated wisdom of the author\u2019s adult self. \u201cIn the struggle between yourself and the world, you must side with the world.\u201d counsel against constructing a narrative around one\u2019s victimization\u2014always being in the right, more sinned against than sinning\u2014if for no other reason than that the self-righteous protagonist becomes repellent. The greater sensitivity that today\u2019s academy brings to issues of stereotyping seems to have rendered writing students preternaturally cautious, as though making any generalizations were invidious. They also refuse to believe, fundamentally, that anyone really wants to know what they think. Share their traumas and abuse stories and feelings, yes, but their thoughts, no. They are deathly afraid of exposing that their innermost thoughts may be banal. What I mean by thinking on the page is something more quicksilver and spontaneous: to question all that might have been transpiring inside and outside themselves at the time, and to catch the hunches, doubts, and digressive associations that dart through their brains. I want you to figure out something on your own, some question to which you don\u2019t already have the answer when you start. Then you can truly engage the reader in the adventure of following you, as you try to come up with deep, unexpected insights, without censoring. You must surprise yourself, and, when you do, it will make you elated and your prose elevated. What I want, in short, is honesty\u2014honesty that will cut through the pious orthodoxies of the moment and ring true. There is nothing more exciting than to follow a live, candid mind thinking on the page, exploring uncharted waters. \u201cboth kings and philosophers defecate, and ladies too,\u201d \u201cConsider how artfully and gently the stone weans you from life and detaches you from the world,\u201d he says, and asks, \u201cBut is there anything so sweet as that sudden change, when from extreme pain, by the voiding of my stone, I come to recover as if by lightning the beautiful light of health, so free and so full, as happens in our sudden and sharpest attacks of colic?\u201d \u201cthe most barbarous or our maladies is to despise our being.\u201d About purists or perfectionists he remarks, \u201cThey want to get out of themselves and escape from the man.

These transcendental humors frighten me.\u201d Montaigne\u2019s attraction to open-endedness or \u201cendlessness,\u201d if you will, has a great deal to do with his seeking a balance, through the sifting of long experience and the acceptance of imperfection. Montaigne was a master of equilibrium; and equilibrium such as he advocated does not drive toward apocalypse or closure of any kind. William Hazlitt, the foremost Romantic essayist. What Hazlitt did, brilliantly, was to posit a unitary self, and to place that self in opposition to the world. Especially in his narrative essays, such as \u201cOn Going a Journey,\u201d \u201cThe Fight,\u201d and \u201cMy First Acquaintance with Poets,\u201d Hazlitt thrust his autobiographical protagonist into action, taking him literally or figuratively on a journey until the inevitable end point, which has been predicted all along. (The fight is over, the friendship is finished, the walk completed, the prospect of love kaput.) Hazlitt\u2019s bristling, touchy I-character, who alternates between a hunger to bond with fellow creatures and a craving for solitude, stemming from that Romantic conviction that he is a Frankenstein\u2019s monster, a malcontent, too singular for polite society, crashes into the public realm, engages, embraces, rejects, or is rejected. The same dramatic plot occurs in Hazlitt\u2019s affecting if creepy Liber Amoris, which tells the sad tale of his unrequited infatuation with a barmaid. \u201cEach man bears the entire form of man\u2019s estate.\u201d as many literary techniques as exist, that is as many ways as are available to conclude an essay. A common mistake students make is to assume they need to tie up with a big bow the preceding matter via a grand statement of what it all means, or what the life lesson to be drawn from it is: too often the result is a platitude. If the essayist can produce a nonplatitudinous larger meaning at the end, fine; if not, then an adequate ending may be achieved by adding a few more pages, it almost doesn\u2019t matter what, just so long as the illusion is sustained that the narrative arc has been completed, which may be nothing more than the reader\u2019s sense that the author has grappled as honestly, bravely, and variously as possible with the problems introduced. Some quandaries may ultimately be impossible to resolve in human terms (ambivalence toward a parent, say, or peace in the Middle East) but may still invite aesthetic resolution: that is, the reader has the sense of having been given a full mental meal and can walk away from the table satisfied. Ozick\u2019s movement from certainty to doubt is appropriate to essays in general, as their explorations come to honor the original question of their founder, Montaigne: \u201cWhat do I know?\u201d Among other things, an essay is a quasi-scientific experiment to discern the limits of one\u2019s knowledge. A person\u2019s thoughts may have no natural stopping point (until death, and maybe beyond that, who knows?), but a person\u2019s knowledge certainly has its limitations. \u201cWe fill our space as if it were a pie shell, with things whose opacity obstructs our ability to see what is already there.\u201d If I remind him of that walk along the Via Nazionale, he says he remembers it, but I know he is lying and that he remembers nothing; and I sometimes ask myself if it was us, these two people, almost twenty years ago on the Via Nazionale, two people who conversed so politely, so urbanely, as the sun was setting; who chatted a little about everything perhaps and about nothing; two friends talking, two young intellectuals out for a walk; so young, so educated, so uninvolved, so ready to judge one another with kind impartiality; so ready to say goodbye to one another for ever, as the sun set, at the corner of the street. writing the ending of an essay has something to do with internalizing the audience\u2019s threshold of patience. \u201cReality\u201d and \u201ctruth\u201d are, of course, ambiguous notions, but still I find myself sitting at my computer, trying to home in closer and closer to the underlying shapes of experience. I have a conviction that life itself has forms underneath it: that there are connections to be made between experience and memory that are not purely subjective but that wait patiently to be brought to the surface. \u201cI was the man\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I suffered\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. I was there.\u201d I have a desire (see \u201cFacts Have Implications\u201d) to find the shape underlying ordinary happenings, through pressing them into artful form. The storyteller: he is the man who could let the wick of his life be consumed completely by the gentle flame of his story.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. The novel is significant, therefore, not because it presents someone else\u2019s fate to us, perhaps didactically, but because this stranger\u2019s fate by virtue of the flame which consumes it yields us the warmth which we never draw from our own fate. What draws the reader to the novel is the hope of warming his shivering life with a death he reads about.\u201d It is sometimes said that psychotherapy helps a patient make a \u201ctellable myth\u201d out of his or her past life, though I assume what is meant by that is a narrative not only capable of being related but shorn of self-deception. The tenth-century Japanese court lady Sei Shonagon kept a writer\u2019s notebook in which she recorded a miscellaneous catchall of things charming and annoying, rhapsodic descriptions of nature, odd facts, and malicious observations of her countrymen. She claimed to be chagrined when it was discovered and read, though a part of her must at least subconsciously have had readers in mind all along. Now considered an indispensable classic, Shonagon\u2019s Pillow Book was also, in a sense, the ancestor of the modern blog. No one can expect to write well who will not first take the risk of writing badly. The writer\u2019s notebook is a safe place for such experiments. I have been keeping a writer\u2019s journal ever since I was seventeen. It fills more than thirty notebooks of all sizes and covers, and every time I\u2019ve moved I have had to lug around that pile, then find a place to store them in file cabinets and closets. I never put them on open bookshelves, because I wouldn\u2019t want a visitor opening one at random and reading, perhaps, about himself. Gertrude Stein says somewhere that those traits of ours which most embarrass us when we are young, we later come to see as our charms. the writer\u2019s notebook invokes the muse, invites thought. Here we might note the phonic similarity between muse and musing. The mother of the Muses is Mnemosyne, goddess of memory; by writing down what you would otherwise forget, even willingly forget, you summon your better self (the muse)\u2014or your worse\u2014with these intimate scribbles. Vivian Gornick\u2019s The Situation and the Story, Carl Klaus\u2019s The Made-Up Self, David Shields\u2019 Reality Hunger, John D\u2019Agata\u2019s The Lost Origins of the Essay, Patricia Hampl\u2019s I Could Tell You Stories, or my own humble efforts. \u201cwe do desperately need new ways of recovering the insights of classical and early modern writers about eloquent speech.\u201d In any case, copious reading for pleasure and the occasional self-conscious imitation can do wonders in stretching one\u2019s syntactical variety. (Those who would like a more systematic approach, from alliteration to zeugma, might consult Figures of Speech by Arthur Quinn, or Writing with Clarity and Style: A Guide to Rhetorical Devices for Contemporary Writers by Robert A. Harris. Georg Luk\u00e1cs, in his meaty \u201cOn the Nature and Form of the Essay,\u201d am coming to think that all good essays are dialogues, and all partake of both exploration and argumentation. The Made-Up Self, Carl H. Klaus Here the creative nonfiction writer can follow the journalists\u2019 lead. Being trained generalists\u2014that is to say, quick studies who can leap opportunistically on intriguing vignettes and facts, give them a vivid twist, and forget the rest\u2014veteran journalists know that they don\u2019t have to become specialists, they just have to absorb enough of the material under scrutiny this week or month to file an interesting story. When you are researching, what you are looking for, subconsciously or not, is the oddity that will spark your imagination\u2014not necessarily the most important detail, but the one that will excite your love of paradox or sense of humor. One of the best parts about researching is that it inspires in you an obligation to finish your writing project, if only to serve faithfully the scholarly materials to which you have become so attached. It is no longer all about you, but about them too, as though they had somehow become your offspring when you weren\u2019t watching. \u201cPrint me, Papa,\u201d beseech those index cards, those notepads, those Post-its. (see Diderot\u2019s Jacques the Fatalist) Montaigne quoted and jousted with the ancients, Seneca, Plutarch, and Cicero, or Lamb invoked in his mannered prose the shades of Thomas Browne, Robert Burton, and the Duchess of Newcastle. \u201cRake not into the bowels of unwelcome truth to save a halfpenny. It is good to believe him. If he be not all that he pretendeth, give, and under a personate father of a family, think (if thou pleasest) that thou hast relieved an indigent bachelor. When they come with their counterfeit looks and mumping tones, think them players. You pay your money to see a comedian feign these things.\u201d Despite the consensus of opprobrium attached to that word today, I take it as a given that personal essayists must examine their prejudices and instinctual aversions as starting points for any honest analysis of their characters and views. But so it is, that there is a secret affinity, a hankering after evil in the human mind, and that it takes a perverse, but fortunate delight in mischief, since it is a never-failing source of satisfaction. Pure good soon grows insipid, wants variety and spirit. Pain is a bitter-sweet which never surfeits. Love turns, with a little indulgence, to indifference and disgust: hatred alone is immortal. \u201cWe hate old friends: we hate old books: we hate old opinions; and at last we come to hate ourselves The only intimacy I never found to flinch or fade was a purely intellectual one. \u201cWe grow tired of everything.\u201d \u201cAs to my old opinions, I am heartily sick of them,\u201d \u201cThe style of middle age is a style of reappraisal, a style characterized by hesitation, by uncertainty, by the objects of the world rather than the passions that transport us from the world.\u201d what I find inspirational about them is their faith in that old dream to which essayists, from Montaigne to the present, have been especially drawn: that you can start off writing about anything, however insignificant, and eventually all thoughts and digressions are somehow connected to each other by an invisible web. At these journals\u2019 core is Emerson\u2019s sense that it is crucial to record one\u2019s fugitive ideas\u2014to note \u201cthe meteorology of thought.\u201d Emerson asserted that \u201cthe purpose of life seems to be to acquaint a man with himself,\u201d Politeness was invented by wise men to keep fools at a distance,\u201d \u201cMy way to help the government is to write sonnets.\u201d \u201cI find no good lives. I would live well. I seem to be free to do so, yet I think with very little respect of my way of living; it is weak, partial, not full & not progressive. But I do not see any other that suits me better.\u201d He put it even more succinctly: \u201cWe are all dying of miscellany.\u201d a drawing up of skirts from the muck of untransformed experience.", "Pascal's Pens\u00e9es": "When we wish to correct with advantage, and to show another that he errs, we must notice from what side he views the matter, for on that side it is usually true, and admit that truth to him, but reveal to him the side on which it is false. He is satisfied with that, for he sees that he was not mistaken, and that he only failed to see all sides. When we wish to correct with advantage, and to show another that he errs, we must notice from what side he views the matter, for on that side it is usually true, and admit that truth to him, but reveal to him the side on which it is false. He is satisfied with that, for he sees that he was not mistaken, and that he only failed to see all sides. Now, no one is offended at not seeing everything; but one does not like to be mistaken, People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come into the mind of others. Eloquence, which persuades by sweetness, not by authority; as a tyrant, not as a king. educated people do not want a sign, and draw little distinction between the trade of a poet and that of an embroiderer. People of education are not called poets or mathematicians, etc.; but they are all these, and judges of all these. People of education are not called poets or mathematicians, etc.; but they are all these, and judges of all these. No one guesses what they are. When they come into society, they talk on matters about which the rest are talking. We do not observe in them one quality rather than another, save when they have to make use of it. [Since we cannot be universal and know all that is to be known of everything, we ought to know a little about everything. For it is far better to know something about everything than to know all about one thing. when we wish to demonstrate a general theorem, we must give the rule as applied to a particular case; but if we wish to demonstrate a particular case, we must begin with the general rule. we always find the thing obscure which we wish to prove, and that clear which we use for the proof; when a thing is put forward to be proved, we first fill ourselves with the imagination that it is therefore obscure, and on the contrary that what is to prove it is clear, and so we understand it easily.", "The Argonauts": "Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly \u201cI love you\u201d is like \u201cthe Argonaut renewing his ship during its voyage without changing its name.\u201d Just as the Argo\u2019s parts may be replaced over time but the boat is still called the Argo, whenever the lover utters the phrase \u201cI love you,\u201d its meaning must be renewed by each use, moment of queer pride is a refusal to be shamed by witnessing the other as being ashamed of you. Sometimes one has to know something many times over. Sometimes one forgets, and then remembers. And then forgets, and then remembers. And then forgets again. I think you overestimate the maturity of adults, Angry and hurt as I may have been by his departure, his observation was undeniably correct. This slice of truth, offered in the final hour, ended up beginning a new chapter of my adulthood, the one in which I realized that age doesn\u2019t necessarily bring anything with it, save itself. The rest is optional. You\u2019re the only one who knows when you\u2019re using things to protect yourself and keep your ego together and when you\u2019re opening and letting things fall apart, letting the world come as it is\u2014working with it rather than struggling against it. You\u2019re the only one who knows. And the thing is, even you don\u2019t always know. In Arabic, the word for fetus derives from jinn, which means \u201chidden from sight.\u201d I might call them \u201cthe many gendered-mothers of my heart,\u201d which is what poet Dana Ward calls everyone from Allen Ginsberg to Barry Manilow to his father to his grandmother to his childhood neighbor to Winona Ryder\u2019s character in Heathers to Ella Fitzgerald to Jacob von Gunten to his bio mom in his amazing long poem \u201cA Kentucky of Mothers,\u201d which accomplishes the nearly impossible feat of constructing an ecstatic matriarchal cosmology while also de-fetishizing the maternal, even emptying the category out, eventually wondering: \u201cBut is \u2018mother of\u2019 precise? / Should I say \u2018singers of\u2019 instead? \u2026 Is it good to call these others as my moms the way I have? Is it care, & if it is have I gave honor in my song?\u201d (Barthes: \u201cone must pluralize, refine, continuously\u201d) (Rule of thumb: when something needs to be willfully erased in order to get somewhere, there is usually a problem.) Homonormativity seems to me a natural consequence of the decriminalization of homosexuality: once something is no longer illicit, punishable, pathologized, or used as a lawful basis for raw discrimination or acts of violence, that phenomenon will no longer be able to represent or deliver on subversion, the subcultural, the underground, the fringe, in the same way. \u201cI still see homosexuality as a narrative of urban adventure, a chance to cross not only sex barriers but class and age barriers, while breaking a few laws in the process\u2014and all for the sake of pleasure. If not, I might as well be straight,\u201d Benderson says. The other day I heard a guy on the radio talking about prehistoric homes, and the particular way humans make home as opposed to, say, birds. It isn\u2019t a penchant for decoration that differentiates us\u2014birds really have a corner on that\u2014it\u2019s the compartmentalization of space. The way we cook and shit and work in different areas. We\u2019ve done this forever, apparently. \u201cthought of as possible, as certain, in the very moment when, in a love deeply sure of itself, a man and a woman wanted you to be.\u201d But I like the sweet assurance he offers his daughter, that she was \u201cthought of as possible, as certain, in the very moment when, in a love deeply sure of itself, a man and a woman wanted you to be.\u201d We bantered good-naturedly, yet somehow allowed ourselves to get polarized into a needless binary. That\u2019s what we both hate about fiction, or at least crappy fiction\u2014it purports to provide occasions for thinking through complex issues, but really it has predetermined the positions, stuffed a narrative full of false choices, and hooked you on them, rendering you less able to see out, to get out. On the inside, we were two human animals undergoing transformations beside each other, bearing each other loose witness. In other words, we were aging. While we talked we said words like nonviolence, assimilation, threats to survival, preserving the radical. But when I think about it now I hear only the background buzz of our trying to explain something to each other, to ourselves, about our lived experiences thus far on this peeled, endangered planet. As is so often the case, the intensity of our need to be understood distorted our positions, backed us further into the cage. Do you want to be right or do you want to connect? ask couples\u2019 therapists everywhere. The aim is not to answer questions, it\u2019s to get out, to get out of it. And yet babies have a will of their own, which becomes visible the first time mine sticks out a limb and makes a tent of my belly. During the night he gets into weird positions, forcing me to plead, Move along, little baby! Get your foot off my lungs! And if you are tracking a problem, as I was, you may have to watch the baby\u2019s body develop in ways that might harm him, with nothing you can do about it. Powerlessness, finitude, endurance. You are making the baby but not directly. You are responsible for his welfare, but unable to control the core elements. You must allow him to unfurl, you must feed his unfurling, you must hold him. But he will unfurl as his cells are programmed to unfurl. You can\u2019t reverse an unfolding structural or chromosomal disturbance by ingesting the right organic tea. Babies grow in a helix of hope and fear; gestating draws one but deeper into the spiral. Even identical genital acts mean very different things to different people. far as I can tell, most worthwhile pleasures on this earth slip between gratifying another and gratifying oneself. Some would call that an ethics. One of the gifts of recognizing oneself in thrall to a substance is the perforation of such subterfuge. In place of an exhausting autonomy, there is the blunt admittance of dependence, and its subsequent relief. I will always aspire to contain my shit as best I can, but I am no longer interested in hiding my dependencies in an effort to appear superior to those who are more visibly undone or aching. Most people decide at some point that it is better \u2026 to be enthralled with what is impoverished or abusive than not to be enthralled at all and so to lose the condition of one\u2019s being and becoming. I\u2019m glad not to be there right now, but I\u2019m also glad to have been there, to know how it is. I have never really thought of myself as a \u201ccreative person\u201d\u2014writing is my only talent, and writing has always felt more clarifying than creative \u201cComing from white trash has advantages people with money don\u2019t seem to understand. For years, I\u2019ve watched friends whose parents are doctors and bankers live in FEAR (even while rebelling) that they don\u2019t achieve enough, aren\u2019t good enough, clean enough, and especially NOT thin enough\u2026. Now, if you don\u2019t mind I have a date with a delicious smartass with a trick jaw who\u2019s on his way over to my place with freshly made chocolate pudding and a can of whipped cream!\u201d A writer is someone who plays with the body of his mother. I don\u2019t know why she has never seen herself as beautiful. I think I\u2019ve been waiting all these years for her to do so, as if that kind of self-love would somehow offer her body to me. But now I realize\u2014she already gave it to me. Throughout my postpartum delirium, I found myself lazily clicking on articles on my AOL home page (yes, AOL) about how certain celebrities got back into shape or into being sexual after babies. It\u2019s humdrum but relentless: the obsession with who\u2019s pregnant and who\u2019s showing and who\u2019s life is transforming due to the imminent arrival of the all-miraculous, all-coveted BABY\u2014all of which flips, in the blink of an eye, into an obsession with how soon all signs of bearing the life-transforming BABY can evaporate, how soon the mother\u2019s career, sex life, weight can be restored, as if nothing ever happened here at all. Who cares what SHE feels like doing? It\u2019s her conjugal duty to get over a massive physical event that has literally rearranged her organs and stretched her parts beyond comprehension and brought her through a life-or-death portal as soon as humanly possible. I think we have a right to our kink and our fatigue, both. how can rampant, \u201cdeviant\u201d sexual activity remain the marker of radicality? What sense does it make to align \u201cqueer\u201d with \u201csexual deviance,\u201d when the ostensibly straight world is having no trouble keeping pace? If queerness is about disturbing normative sexual assumptions and practices, isn\u2019t one of these that sex is the be-all and end-all? What if Beatriz Preciado is right\u2014what if we\u2019ve entered a new, post-Fordist era of capitalism that Preciado calls the \u201cpharma-copornographic era,\u201d whose principal economic resource is nothing other than \u201cthe insatiable bodies of the multitudes\u2014their cocks, clitorises, anuses, hormones, and neurosexual synapses \u2026 [our] desire, excitement, sexuality, seduction, and \u2026 pleasure\u201d? Faced with the warp speed of this \u201cnew kind of hot, psychotropic, punk capitalism,\u201d especially from my station of fatigue, exchanging horniness for exhaustion grows in allure. Unable to fight my station, at least for the time being, I try to learn from it; another self, stripped. I first met Sedgwick in a graduate seminar titled Non-Oedipal Models of Psychology. By way of introduction, she announced that she had started going to therapy because she wanted to be happier. To hear a scary theoretical heavyweight admit such a thing changed my life. Then, without missing a beat, she said she wanted to play a quick get-to-know-you game involving totem animals. Totem animals? How could it be that I had fled the spacey Haight-Ashbury of my youth for hard-core, intellectual New York, explicitly to escape games involving totem animals, only to find myself in the middle of one in a doctoral classroom? The game placed an icy finger on my identity phobia: it was but a short leap from here, I felt, to the index card, Sharpie, and lapel pin. Perhaps anticipating this horror, Sedgwick explained to us that the game had a kind of out. She said that we were free to offer up a fake animal, a kind of decoy identification, if we so desired\u2014if, for example, we had a \u201creal\u201d totem animal that we would prefer to keep to ourselves. I didn\u2019t have a real or fake animal, and so I just sweated as we went around the room. When it got to me, I burped out otter. Which was a form of true. It was important to me back then to feel, to be wily. To feel small, slick, quick, amphibious, dexterous, capable. I didn\u2019t know then Barthes\u2019s book The Neutral, but if I had, it would have been my anthem\u2014the Neutral being that which, in the face of dogmatism, the menacing pressure to take sides, offers novel responses: to flee, to escape, to demur, to shift or refuse terms, to disengage, to turn away. The otter was thus a complex sort of stand-in, or fake-out, another identity I felt sure I could shimmy out of. I know now that a studied evasiveness has its own limitations, its own ways of inhibiting certain forms of happiness and pleasure. The pleasure of abiding. The pleasure of insistence, of persistence. The pleasure of obligation, the pleasure of dependency. The pleasures of ordinary devotion. The pleasure of recognizing that one may have to undergo the same realizations, write the same notes in the margin, return to the same themes in one\u2019s work, relearn the same emotional truths, write the same book over and over again\u2014not because one is stupid or obstinate or incapable of change, but because such revisitations constitute a life. \u201cMany people doing all kinds of work are able to take pleasure in aspects of their work,\u201d Sedgwick once wrote, \u201cbut something different happens when the pleasure is not only taken but openly displayed. I like to make that different thing happen.\u201d One happy thing that can happen, according to Sedgwick, is that pleasure becomes accretive as well as autotelic: the more it\u2019s felt and displayed, the more proliferative, the more possible, the more habitual, it becomes. The way Sedgwick interprets it, it wasn\u2019t just her linking of a canonical writer with the filthy specter of self-pleasuring that struck her critics as depraved. More galling was the spectacle of a writer or thinker\u2014be it Sedgwick or Austen\u2014who finds her work happy-making, and who celebrates it publicly as such. Worse still, in a culture committed to bleeding the humanities to death, along with any other labors of love that don\u2019t serve the God of capital: the spectacle of someone who likes her pointless, perverse work and gets paid\u2014even paid well\u2014for it. One night during our courtship, I came home to find the stump with bolts lying across the welcome mat of my porch. You had left town, and I had been baffled by your departure. But when I ascended my front steps and saw the weapon, shadowy in the twilight, I knew you loved me. It was a talisman of protection\u2014a means of keeping myself safe while you were gone, a tool to fight off the suitors (had there been any). I\u2019ve kept it by my bedside ever since. Not because I think they\u2019re coming for us per se. But because it makes the brutal tender, which I\u2019ve since learned is one of your principal gifts. This little boy lived by the maxim that if you could imagine the worst thing that could ever happen, you would never be surprised when it did. Not knowing that this maxim was the very definition of anxiety, as given by Freud (\u201c\u2018Anxiety\u2019 describes a particular state of expecting the danger or preparing for it, even though it may be an unknown one\u201d), I set to work cultivating it. Most of my writing usually feels to me like a bad idea, which makes it hard for me to know which ideas feel bad because they have merit, and which ones feel bad because they don\u2019t. But somewhere along the line, from my heroes, whose souls were forged in fires infinitely hotter than mine, I gained an outsized faith in articulation itself as its own form of protection. The mother of an adult child sees her work completed and undone at the same time. What is good is always being destroyed: one of Winnicott\u2019s main axioms. Can one prepare for one\u2019s undoing? How has my mother withstood mine? Why do I continue to undo her, when what I want to express above all else is that I love her very much? Babies do not remember being held well\u2014what they remember is the traumatic experience of not being held well enough. Some might read in this a recipe for the classic ungratefulness of children\u2014after everything I\u2019ve done for you, and so on. To me, at the moment anyway, it is a tremendous relief, an incitement to give Iggy no memory, save the sense, likely unconscious, of having once been gathered together, made to feel real. That is what my mother did for me. I\u2019d almost forgotten. And now, I think I can say\u2014 I want you to know, you were thought of as possible\u2014never as certain, but always as possible\u2014not in any single moment, but over many months, even years, of trying, of waiting, of calling\u2014when, in a love sometimes sure of itself, sometimes shaken by bewilderment and change, but always committed to the charge of ever-deepening understanding\u2014two human animals, one of whom is blessedly neither male nor female, the other of whom is female (more or less), deeply, doggedly, wildly wanted you to be. After Iggy is released from the hospital post-toxin, we celebrate with one of our living room dance parties, just me and the three Irish guys, so called to honor the otherwise un-addressed genetic link each of them has to Irish stock. We play \u201cTightrope\u201d by Janelle Mon\u00e1e over and over again (after years of noise metal, Harry now also keeps abreast of the Top 40, so that he can discuss the finer points of the new Katy Perry, Daft Punk, or Lorde). Iggy\u2019s big brother holds him by the armpits and spins him around in a wild circle while we scramble to make sure Iggy\u2019s chubby legs don\u2019t hit any windows or end tables. As one might expect for brothers seven years apart, they almost always play too rough for my liking. But he loves it! his brother says whenever I tell him to take the heavy faux-fur blanket off Iggy\u2019s head for a moment, so we can be sure he hasn\u2019t smothered. But for the most part, he\u2019s right. Iggy loves it. Iggy loves playing with his brother and his brother loves playing with Iggy in ways I could never have dreamt. His brother especially loves dragging Iggy around his schoolyard, bragging about how soft his little brother\u2019s head is to mostly preoccupied peers. Who wants to touch a really soft head? he yells, as if hawking wares. It stresses me out to watch them play, but it also makes me feel like I\u2019ve finally done something unequivocally good. That I\u2019ve finally done my stepson an unequivocal good. He\u2019s mine, all mine, he says as he scoops Iggy up and runs off with him to another room. When all the mythologies have been set aside, we can see that, children or no children, the joke of evolution is that it is a teleology without a point, that we, like all animals, are a project that issues in nothing.", "In Search of Jeffersons Moose: Notes on the State of Cyberspace (Law and Current Events Masters)": "The Internet, like Virginia, has been growing geometrically (see fig. 2.4), at a rate of just under 5 percent a month (about 80 percent per year), yielding an \u201caverage doubling time\u201d of about fourteen months. a slowdown in the growth rate, for the Internet around about 1999 or 2000. There has been considerable commentary about this apparent slowdown in growth. It occurred, presumably not coincidentally, just at the time the dot-com investment bubble burst, and many have speculated on the extent to which the one was a consequence, or a cause, of the other. But the interesting thing isn\u2019t the slowdown. It couldn\u2019t have gone on for too much longer at the rate it was going in any event; at 5 percent a month, there would have been around 1.35 billion machines on the network by 2005, 25 billion by 2010, 165 trillion in the year 2025\u2014more than a thousand Internet-connected computers for everyone on earth! The interesting thing is that it occurred at all, and for so long. There\u2019s not much else on the planet that grew exponentially for this long a period, and nothing\u2014at least, nothing I can think of\u2014that did so at this astonishing rate. If some living organism, or some population of organisms, had managed to grow exponentially in size over the past thirty-five years at the rate the TCP/IP network did, we\u2019d surely want to understand what was going on, and how it managed to do that. the world of long-range computer communications in the late 1970s and early 1980s was awash (as it is still, today) with dozens, even hundreds, of different networking schemes and systems. During the ensuing two decades, it was TCP/IP that triumphed, the TCP/IP network that outgrew them all. Why? It didn\u2019t grow so fast or become so big because it was \u201cthe Internet\u201d; it became \u201cthe Internet\u201d because it grew so fast and became so big. TCP/IP network become \u201cthe Internet\u201d was that it had a head start\u2014and when it comes to networks, head starts can make a big difference. Bigger networks, all other things being equal, are better, just because they\u2019re bigger. In network-speak: Network value scales positively as a function of network size; as the latter increases, so does the former. the value of a one-way communications network\u2014like a radio or television broadcast network, in which communication goes in only one direction, from source to recipient\u2014is proportional to N, the number of network members. Network Value ~ N \u201cMetcalfe\u2019s Law\u201d states that, on average, the value of networks that permit two-way communication\u2014networks on which each participant can be both a source and recipient (like the postal network, or the telephone network)\u2014scales geometrically with the number of participants on the network \u201cReed\u2019s Law,\u201d named for David Reed, an important figure in the development of TCP/IP whom we will meet again later in the book, which holds that the value of a \u201cgroup-forming network\u201d\u2014like the Internet, a network that allows not just two-way communication among individual members but multi-way communication among groups of various sizes\u2014scales even faster than that. Hyper-geometrically, the mathematicians call it: Network Value ~ 2N makes for a potentially dizzying positive feedback loop: As networks get bigger, they become more valuable; as they become more valuable, more people want to join; as more people join, they get bigger; as they get bigger, they get even more valuable; that makes even more people want to join \u2026 and so on. That\u2019s why head starts are of such significance for networks: For a network, a good strategy for getting bigger is to be big. The bigger the network, the more likely (all other things being equal) that it will get even bigger. Jefferson was a network engineer (before anyone called it \u201cnetwork engineering\u201d) of great skill and considerable achievement. The \u201cnetwork\u201d on which Jefferson focused his attention was the network that mattered in eighteenth-century America: the network of rivers. Rivers, not roads, formed the backbone for the network(s) of communication and commerce over which goods and people and information could flow in the New World, and it was riverine topography\u2014the location, size, and navigability of the New World\u2019s rivers\u2014that defined the architecture of those networks, and that would play a crucial role in determining who, and what, could go where. Jefferson had big plans to make this a bigger, and a better, network. He was, you will perhaps not be surprised to learn, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on canal technology and design. To become the Internet, the TCP/IP network had to be able to handle the numbers; it had to solve the problem(s) of scale. How it did so is one of the great (and under-appreciated) achievements in the history of information processing and human communication. Communications networks, it turns out, have profound scaling problems of their own\u2014not the same as the moose\u2019s, but not unrelated to them, either. Understanding the Internet means understanding something about how it solved (and continues to solve) them. Networks, of course, don\u2019t have to obtain energy or avoid predators or reproduce; but they do have to get messages reliably from one place to another, and that gets a lot harder to do as they grow in size. On a network on which all information is in digital form, the addressing protocol has two components: first, some code (like the familiar ASCII Code) to translate the 1s and 0s that are being transmitted to the server into machine names (Alice = 10010011, Bob = 0011100, Charlie = 10110110, etc); and second, some rule about where in the stream of digits the recipient\u2019s name is to be found The server will also need to keep track of the location of all network machines. \u201crouting table,\u201d a simple list or database that contains the names of all machines alongside the location of each of them. A twofold increase in size, in other words, leads to a roughly eightfold (23) increase in the number of operations the server has to perform. Geometric growth! The number of operations is increasing roughly as the cube of the number of machines on the network. The amount of work that the network has to do is an exponential function of the number of machines and the number of messages, which are themselves growing exponentially. We know that it doesn\u2019t use this central server design\u2014but how then do messages get where they\u2019re supposed to go? Without a central server to keep track of who everybody is and where everybody is, who keeps track? Who\u2019s got the routing table? Who is responsible for getting messages to the right place? To manage this problem, TCP/IP uses something called \u201cdistributed routing,\u201d To form a TCP/IP network out of our ten machines, we can connect them together any which way. Like this: Or this: uses a numerical identifier known as an \u201cInternet Protocol Address\u201d (or \u201cIP Address\u201d),12 and messages don\u2019t actually bounce around from machine to machine entirely at random. It splits the work of routing into pieces, and parcels it out\u2014distributes it\u2014among the network machines themselves. a distributed system the network as a whole subjects every message to a series of questions, one machine at a time: \u201cIs this message addressed to me?\u201d \u201cIs this message addressed to me?\u201d \u201cIs this message addressed to me?\u201d The aggregate work\u2014reading the addresses on the messages and making some decision about where to send it\u2014still gets done, but it has been split up into pieces and spread around. All machines are locatable, even though nobody has the information about where everybody is located (i.e., even though there\u2019s no master routing table). Even though each machine has information concerning only the location of the machines to which it is connected\u2014its \u201clocal\u201d neighborhood\u2014messages can indeed get where they are supposed to go anywhere on the network. distributed routing lets TCP/IP networks grow from any point. Centralized networks grow radially\u2014outward from the center, a TCP/IP network grows like a bush, each of whose terminal twigs can sprout new twigs, or like a coral reef; every machine already on the network\u2014every point on the Peacock Map\u2014can serve as the point of attachment for a machine or machines joining the network. New entrants can join the network at any point. Because every machine already on a TCP/IP network can perform its part of the critical network function\u2014getting messages to and from anyone on the network\u2014new machines can join a TCP/IP network anywhere, i.e., by connecting to any machine that is itself already on the network. the TCP/IP network grows and the number of machines increases, the number of points to which others can attach themselves also increases; as the network grows, its ability to grow grows. The Internet could grow as fast as it did also because it is a very stupid network, thanks to a principle known as \u201cend-to-end\u201d (or \u201ce2e\u201d) design. The Transport Layer is \u201clower\u201d than the Interpretation Layer in several senses. First, the lawyers need it, but it doesn\u2019t need the lawyers. That is, if the Transport Layer protocols break down, lawyers can\u2019t send mail to one another; but if the lawyers\u2019 Interpretation Layer protocols break down, the Transport Layer is entirely unaffected, and the system can continue to transport mail perfectly well for doctors, scientists, and (as Wu puts it) \u201cother interpreters of strange lingo.\u201d Second, the Transport Layer is \u201clower\u201d in the sense that it is more fundamental; Interpretation Layer protocols have to comply with Transport Layer rules, but the reverse is not true. The Internet uses a similar layering of functions, with a \u201cNetwork Layer\u201d running beneath an \u201cApplications Layer.\u201d Network Layer protocols control the processing of messages as they move through the network from sender to recipient; Applications Layer protocols control the processing of messages by senders/recipients; Like the rules of English and Legalese, these are interpretive protocols; they take the bit-streams handed over by the Network Layer and they process them so as to turn then into \u201cemail messages,\u201d or \u201cweb pages,\u201d or \u201cpictures,\u201d or \u201cmusic files,\u201d etc.1 the e2e principle can be stated as: PUSH AS MUCH PROCESSING UP THE PROTOCOL STACK AND OUT TO THE PERIPHERY OF THE NETWORK AS POSSIBLE. LET THEM DO THE WORK. In an e2e network, the Network Layer does the minimum number of tasks required to get messages from one place to another. Network Layer protocols in e2e networks are stripped down and simple\u2014at least, as simple as the engineers can get them to be\u2014and they do nothing except message routing and transport. Everything else is left for the applications running on the machines at the network periphery, for the sender(s) and the recipient(s) of the messages to work out, as it were, for themselves. These are all important and useful functions. The Network Layer protocols could perform any or all of them. But, on e2e networks, they don\u2019t. All of that additional processing (and more) is pushed up and out, to the Applications Layer and to the network periphery. The Network Layer is stripped down to its essentials; it does only what is necessary to get bit-strings where they are supposed to go. \u201cWork all of those things out for yourselves, end-to-end.\u201d The Network Layer gets the message to E, and then\u2014figuratively speaking\u2014it says: \u201cHere\u2019s a message for you. I don\u2019t know what it says, or what it means, or what you\u2019re supposed to do with it. As far as I am concerned, it\u2019s just a bunch of ones and zeroes with an address on it. It was addressed to you, so here it is.\u201d Smart machines, connected to a dumb network. Complicated and sophisticated applications, and a network doing nothing more than moving bits around as directed by those applications. That\u2019s the Internet. This \u201cInternet\u201d that everyone is talking about is, fundamentally, nothing more than a gigantic global machine designed to move zeroes and ones from one place to another. End-to-end design is not the same as decentralization. The postal network, for example, is a centralized e2e network; a single institution (the post office) is given the responsibility for implementing the Transport Layer protocols (centralization), and those protocols focus on a single task: getting messages reliably from point A to point B across the network (e2e). Users The Internet, though, is both decentralized and end-to-end. being stupid helped that little TCP/IP network become \u201cthe Internet.\u201d Because the network layer protocols are kept so simple, needing only to know the address of the machine to which each string of bits is to be sent, it doesn\u2019t matter (to the network) what language was used to create the string of bits, what language should be used to interpret it, or what it might \u201cmean\u201d; the machines at the end-points can figure all of that out. doesn\u2019t matter, for purposes of joining the TCP/IP network, what machine L is doing in its spare (i.e., off-network) time\u2014what language(s) it uses to communicate with the members of its own sub-network (i.e., its own internal networking system protocols), what applications it runs, or what operating system(s) it uses. The only thing that matters is that when L communicates over the TCP/IP network\u2014when it sends something to machine H for distribution over the inter-network\u2014it addresses the message properly (i.e., in accordance with the TCP/IP rules). So a TCP/IP network can not only add new members anywhere (thanks to distributed routing, see chap. 4), it can add anyone (thanks to e2e design). Doubt is wisdom.\u2026 Ignorance is preferable to error. He is less remote from the truth who believes nothing, than he who believes what is wrong.\u2026 The wise know too well their weakness to assume infallibility; he who knows most, knows best how little he knows. TJ TO MARQUIS DE CHASTELLUX, JUNE 7, 1785/TJ NOTES ON THE STATE OF VIRGINIA know of no other writer more willing to utter the words \u201cI don\u2019t understand this\u201d than he. For someone who knew so much, who had so much information about the world at his fingertips\u2014someone who could write Notes on the State of Virginia\u2014he is remarkably candid about his own ignorance; Notes is as much a catalogue of the things Jefferson did not understand as of those he did. this was the whole point of the intellectual enterprise, for Jefferson\u2014identifying those things that are, with our current understanding, inexplicable. He who knows most, knows best how little he knows. Nobody believed more fervently than Jefferson that the important intellectual action is always at the frontier, the place where collective knowledge and understanding butt up against ignorance, the border between The Land of What We Know and The Land of What We Don\u2019t Know. And nobody believed more fervently than Jefferson that science and human knowledge would, over time, push that boundary \u201coutward,\u201d converting territory within Not-Known to Known. When I contemplate the immense advances in science and discoveries which have been made within the period of my life, I look forward with confidence to equal advances by the present generation, and I have no doubt they will consequently be as much wiser than we have been as we than our fathers were, and they than the burners of witches. Lots of machines have a mere handful of connections (the left-hand portion of the curve), and, conversely, a handful of machines have lots of connections (the right-hand portion of the curve). The most-connected 1 percent of all machines (the points way out there on the right-hand side of the curve) account for more than one-third of the total number of connections in the sample as a whole.3 that machines on the Internet connect together in this power law manner was of crucial importance for allowing this inter-network to scale as well as it did. It meant that the \u201cdistance\u201d between any two machines on the inter-network (measured as the number of intermediate \u201chops\u201d between them) is much smaller, and increases much more slowly as the network grows, than expected. Networks in which connectivity follows a power law are what network scientists call \u201csmall worlds,\u201d because they can grow to immense size while remaining astonishingly compact with respect to getting from one point on the network to the other. In the late 1990s, there were around 800 million documents on the power law/small world network known as the World Wide Web, and you could, on average, get from any one page to any other page, following the hyperlinks from one page to another, in around nineteen steps. Pretty amazing. But even more amazing: if you were to increase the size of this network 100-fold\u2014adding an additional 80 billion new pages\u2014the average distance from any one page to any other page would increase only by two (to around twenty-one). Distributed routing\u2014bouncing messages from machine to machine\u2014can scale on a small world network, because you can add orders of magnitude more machines, and more information, without proportionally increasing the length of the journey from one point on the network to any other point. A language cannot be too rich. The more copious [it is], the more susceptible of embellishment it will become \u2026 The variety of dialects constitutes [ its ] riches. The TCP/IP network is like that\u2014it\u2019s an agar, not for growing the little bits of code we call microbes but for growing the little bits of code we call computer applications and computer languages. Their new protocol would let you do two things: (a) embed information into a file regarding the existence and the location of other files (\u201chypertext links\u201d); and (b) request copies of those other files. they needed, first, some standardized format for these hypertext documents, i.e., rules about how these \u201chypertext links,\u201d containing the information about the existence of other files, were to be embedded into documents. Second, they needed to standardize a protocol for communication between \u201cweb servers\u201d (i.e., machines with files that had been formatted in accordance with the HTML rules) and \u201cweb browsers\u201d (machines capable of decoding and displaying those files), a kind of grammar that would enable \u201cbrowsers\u201d to request files from \u201cservers\u201d and for \u201cservers\u201d to send those files (the hypertext transfer protocol, \u201cHTTP\u201d). Finally, they needed some standard addressing format that would be used to identify the location of these remote files (the uniform resource locator [\u201cURL\u201d] system). Those are large tasks, to be sure. But it\u2019s what they didn\u2019t need that is more interesting; they didn\u2019t need to tell anyone or get anyone\u2019s permission to start using their new language over the existing TCP/IP network. once Berners-Lee and Cailliau had developed what they believed to be working versions of their new protocols, they could simply try them out for themselves. They could just start using them to communicate with each another (and with anyone else they could persuade to \u201cspeak\u201d in the new language), using the existing TCP/IP network to transport their requests and their files as directed. End-to-end. Language communities are themselves a kind of network, subject to the same bigger-is-better scaling principle as other networks: the more speakers of a language there are, the more useful and powerful the language is to each of them. Innovation on this inter-network doesn\u2019t come from the center spreading outward; it comes from the periphery, spreading in and around. It was the seemingly unending supply of new applications, new languages that could make those bits do useful and interesting things, running \u201cover the Internet\u201d\u2014\u201con top\u201d of the Network Layer protocols\u2014that made this inter-network so interesting, and that attracted users to it (which then, of course, made it even more attractive to others\u2014Metcalfe\u2019s Law!). All that the Network Layer protocols had to do was to move the bits around as directed from one place to another\u2014and to be able to handle the extraordinary surge in the number of messages (and the number of network members) that would accompany each successful new application. Who controls these languages of cyberspace? Who decides what languages we may use, and what we may say? Who \u201cgoverns\u201d here? \u201cbalance between liberty and authority,\u201d Merrill Peterson wrote, \u201cJefferson tipped the former scale, Hamilton the latter: One despised, the other idolized, rulership. One located the strength of the republic in the diffuse energies of a free society, the other in the consolidation of authority.\u2026 Hamilton feared most the ignorance and tumult of the people, Jefferson feared the irresponsibility of rulers independent of them. Hamilton labeled his rival a visionary and a demagogue, while Jefferson named his a corrupter, a monarchist, and an Angloman. Jefferson and Jeffersonians think The will of the people \u2026 is the only legitimate foundation of any government, [and] the people of every country are the only safe guardian of their own rights \u2026 No other depositories of power have ever yet been found, which did not end in converting to their own profit the earnings of those committed to their charge.\u2026 Malo periculosam libertatem quam quietam servitutem. [I prefer the tumult of liberty to the quiet of servitude.] Difference of opinion leads to inquiry, and inquiry to truth.\u2026 A truth that has never been opposed cannot acquire that firm and unwavering assent, which is given to that which has stood the test of a rigorous examination. Expansion of the Union, Hamilton believed, could only proceed hand-in-hand with federal power, the new government\u2019s ability to project force and to maintain order from its base of operations on the eastern seaboard. Overextend the union beyond that limit, and the result would be, as Hamilton put it, \u201cdespotism or anarchy \u2026 dismemberment or dissolution.\u201d To Jefferson, the West wasn\u2019t a problem to be solved, it was an opportunity to be seized; not a bug, but a feature. I have much confidence that we shall proceed successfully for ages to come, and that, contrary to the principle of Montesquieu, it will be seen that the larger the extent of country, the more firm its republican structure, if founded, not on conquest, but in principles of compact and equality. My hope of its duration is built much on the enlargement of the resources of life going hand in hand with the enlargement of territory, and the belief that men are disposed to live honestly, if the means of doing so are open to them.\u2026 I have [the consolation] of other prophets who foretell distant events, that I shall not live to see it falsified. My theory has always been that if we are to dream, the flatteries of hope are as cheap, and pleasanter, than the gloom of despair. Cyberspace is not the American West of 1787, of course. But like the American West of 1787, cyberspace is (or at least it has been) a Jeffersonian kind of place. Jeffersonians always predominate in new places, because new places attract people who find new places attractive and repel people who do not. Jefferson biographer Joseph Ellis called cyberspace the \u201cperfect Jeffersonian environment,\u201d all decentralization and disorder, growth and expansion, a frontier that is constantly expanding and seemingly illimitable. Hamiltonians, though, inevitably make their way to Jeffersonian places (certainly once gold is discovered there!), claims of order and authority and power assert themselves, and struggles over the shape of the place begin in earnest. Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. cyberspace poses some hard questions, and could use some new ideas, about governance, and law, and order, and scale. The engineers have bequeathed to us a remarkable instrument, one that has managed to solve prodigious technical problems associated with communication on a global scale. The problem is the one that Jefferson and his contemporaries faced: How do you build \u201crepublican\u201d institutions\u2014institutions that respect the equal worth of all individuals and their right to participate in the formation of the rules under which they live\u2014that scale? by comparing similarities and differences among existing languages you could \u201croll back\u201d the tree of evolutionary descent to common linguistic ancestors farther and farther back in time to determine how many ages have elapsed since the English, the Dutch, the Germans, the Swiss, the Norwegians, Danes and Swedes have separated from their common stock, much as today\u2019s evolutionary biologists use comparative anatomy or comparative DNA sequences among living species to reconstruct lines of evolutionary descent. if languages have a past\u2014a rich evolutionary history, full of change and modification\u2014it meant that they must also have a future; if they are not today what they were yesterday, then presumably they will not be tomorrow what they are today. Which raises a (new) question, one that had not been asked before: Who controls that future, and how? It is not to be disputed that the form of government has an influence upon language, and language in its turn influences not only the form of government, but the temper, the sentiments, and manners of the people.\u2026 He was no fan of the European language academies,2 whose sole purpose, as he saw it, was to arrest the progress of language by fixing it to a Dictionary, outside of which no word can be sought, used, or tolerated. I am no friend to what Dictionaries are but the depositories of words already legitimated by usage. Society is the workshop in which new ones are elaborated. When an individual uses a new word, if ill formed, it is rejected in society; if well formed, adopted, and after due time, laid up in the depository of dictionaries. Where brevity, perspicuity, and even euphony can be promoted by the introduction of a new word, it is an improvement to the language. Positive feedback: the more language is embellished, the more susceptible it becomes to embellishment; the more it grows, the more it can grow, and so on. New and unanticipated circumstances, new knowledge, and new forms of social organization would require new words, new dialects, and new languages. Had the preposterous idea of fixing the language been adopted by our Saxon ancestors, the progress of ideas must have stopped with that of the language.\u2026 Without [neologism] we should still be held to the vocabulary of [the ancients], and held to their state of science also, for I am sure they had no words which could have conveyed the ideas of oxigen [sic], cotyledons, zoophytes, magnetism, electricity, hyaline, and thousands of others expressing ideas not then existing. Necessity obliges us to neologize.\u2026 The new circumstances under which we are placed, call for new words, new phrases, and for the transfer of old words to new objects. What has destroyed liberty and the rights of man in every government which has ever existed under the sun? The generalizing and concentrating all cares and powers into one body It is not by the consolidation or concentration of powers, but by their distribution, that good government is effected. It is difficult enough to bring the place, or the thing, itself\u2014the Internet, cyberspace, the global network\u2014into focus, let alone to think of it as \u201chaving law,\u201d or as \u201cbeing governed.\u201d It just moves bits from one place to another; what kind of law or governance does it have, what kind of law or governance can it have, and what kind of law or governance does it need? What would it mean, to \u201cgovern the Internet,\u201d or to \u201cmake law\u201d there? it\u2019s also difficult to wrap one\u2019s mind around these questions because so much of the language we use to talk about law and governance is tied to law and governance in realspace, in Virginia\u2014but we\u2019re not, to paraphrase Dorothy, in Virginia anymore. the UN\u2019s pronouncements on \u201cInternet governance\u201d do sound particularly Orwellian to my ear\u2014\u201cdesigned,\u201d as Orwell put it, \u201cto give an appearance of solidity to pure wind\u201d Cyberspace presents something new for those who think about regulation and freedom. It demands a new understanding of how regulation works and of what regulates life there. It compels us to look beyond the traditional lawyer\u2019s scope\u2014beyond laws, regulations, and norms.\u2026 In cyberspace we must understand how code regulates\u2014how the software and hardware that make cyberspace what it is regulate cyberspace as it is. As William Mitchell puts it, this code is cyberspace\u2019s \u201claw.\u201d Code is law. LAWRENCE LESSIG, CODE AND OTHER LAWS OF CYBERSPACE (EMPHASIS IN ORIGINAL) The network, in a sense, is its code\u2014the \u201cinstructions imbedded in the software and hardware that make cyberspace work,\u201d The code\u2014or, more properly, the codes, the many languages that flourish up and down the Internet\u2019s protocol stack\u2014is law on the network in the sense that, like law, it constrains what you may or may not do there. Code doesn\u2019t necessarily replace what we ordinarily think of as \u201claw\u201d on the network\u2014the law of statutes and regulations and court decisions and the rest\u2014so much as it functions alongside, and interacts with, that law to govern what you can or cannot do there.3 Lessig\u2019s point is not that the HTTP Referrer field is \u201claw\u201d in the ordinary sense but rather that, like law, it constrains or regulates what you can and cannot do, enabling certain kinds of activities while disadvantaging or disabling others. in a place like cyberspace constructed entirely out of such \u201cWest Coast code,\u201d sometimes it is that code, and not the \u201cEast Coast code\u201d in the statute books and judicial opinions, that has the greatest impact on what can and cannot be done there. Who decided to put a Referrer field into the HTTP Protocol? This is what governance questions look like here, in cyberspace. reasons\u2014the staggering growth in Internet use, obviously among them, but also various inefficiencies in the way that IP allocates IP Addresses\u2014it may not be enough, and we may run out of IP Addresses, soon.4 What is to be done? Should the Internet Protocol be changed in order to fix this problem? If so, in what way? They\u2019re technical questions, but they\u2019re not just technical questions; the rules, even this far down in the protocol stack\u2014especially this far down in the protocol stack\u2014will have far-reaching consequences for everyone who uses the network, constraining what they can and cannot do, enabling certain kinds of activities while disadvantaging or disabling others. The consequences of this change for what we can and cannot do on the Internet would be far reaching. To begin with, with so many numbers at our disposal, every single device that might conceivably be used to exchange information over the Internet\u2014every cell phone, every toaster oven, every automobile engine monitor, every compass, every video recorder, every computer, every satellite radio receiver, every billboard, every television\u2014could have its very own IP Address (or even multiple IP Addresses) permanently built in, hardwired into its circuitry as it leaves the factory. Pretty much everything\u2014everything man-made, at least\u2014could now be, as the engineers put it, \u201caddressable.\u201d switch to IPv6 might also make Internet communications much easier to trace than on today\u2019s Internet. who decides what is to be done? Who decides whether we need a new version of the Internet Protocol, and what that new version should look like? If code is law, then, as William Mitchell writes, \u201ccontrol of code is power\u201d: \u201cFor citizens of cyberspace \u2026 code \u2026 is becoming a crucial focus of political contest. Who shall write that software that increasingly structures our daily lives?\u201d As the world is now, code writers are increasingly lawmakers. They determine what the defaults of the Internet will be; whether privacy will be protected; the degree to which anonymity will be allowed; the extent to which access will be guaranteed \u2026 Their decisions, now made in the interstices of how the Net is coded, define what the Net is.\u201d Nothing about the Internet is more remarkable than the process by which new protocols become (or don\u2019t become) part of the TCP/IP protocols (and by which existing TCP/IP protocols are modified). These basic rules for the Internet\u2014this multi-trillion dollar, globally transformative thing, or place, or medium, or whatever you want to call it\u2014are set by anyone who wants to participate in the process of setting them, through an organization that has no formal legal existence or fixed place of operation or salaried employees, that is open to anyone who wishes to join, that has no dues or other membership requirements, and that takes action only when there is a consensus among everybody involved that it should do so. is, in its own words, less an organization in the ordinary sense and more \u201ca collection of happenings\u201d\u2014a large, and fairly chaotic, series of overlapping ongoing discussions about standards and protocols for the Internet. The organization is known as the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF publishes and maintains the set of documents that, collectively, make up the \u201cInternet Standards\u201d\u2014the \u201cofficial\u201d protocol set for the global TCP/IP network. A proposal for a new protocol has to complete three full circuits up and down the IETF before it becomes an \u201cInternet Standard.\u201d The process is one of distillation and refinement: each time through, the proposal has to meet more stringent criteria for approval. At each step, the decision whether to approve the proposal and to keep it moving forward is based on the two fundamental IETF criteria: rough consensus and running code We reject: kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code. \u201cRough consensus\u201d is both undefined and, probably, undefinable. It means\u2014roughly\u2014that pretty much everybody agrees that the proposal has met the required criteria for approval. Not necessarily everybody; true unanimity is not required. But a \u201cvery large majority of those who care must agree,\u201d with no \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d disagreement; a proposal that cannot demonstrate that \u201cmost of the working group members think that it is the right thing to do\u201d will not be approved. The exact method of determining rough consensus varies from Working Group to Working Group. Sometimes consensus is determined by \u201chumming\u201d; if you agree with a proposal, you hum when prompted by the chair; if you disagree, you keep your silence. Newcomers find it quite peculiar, but it works. RFC 3160, \u201cTHE TAO OF THE IETF\u201d No votes are ever taken, and there\u2019s no fixed percentage of support that a proposal must achieve in order to be approved, no attempt to impart mathematical precision to the meaning of a \u201cvery large majority,\u201d or \u201cpretty much everybody,\u201d or \u201csignificant,\u201d or \u201csubstantial.\u201d \u201cRunning code\u201d means that the protocol works\u2014not in theory or on the blackboard but in actual practice, on the network. \u201cQuit jawing; throw it out on the Net and see if it works,\u201d in Pauline Borsook\u2019s nice paraphrase. The proposal must actually have been implemented (in at least two \u201cindependent implementations\u201d) in actual code built in accordance with the proposed protocol\u2019s specifications, and the code has to have been used operationally on the actual Internet without screwing things up\u2014without interfering or somehow conflicting with the other functions the Internet is performing or with any of the other code out there built in accordance with other Internet Standards (the requirement of \u201cinteroperability\u201d). If code is law, then this is lawmaking, and if this is lawmaking, it\u2019s a pretty remarkable form of lawmaking\u2014an ongoing series of little town meetings, with dozens, or perhaps hundreds, of documents making their way up, or down, the review chain at any point in time, everyone looking to see whether there\u2019s a rough consensus that whatever is described in the document is a good thing to do (or at least that there are no good reasons to believe that it\u2019s not a good thing to do). Who gave the IETF the authority to do this? Who put them in charge? The answer, of course, is that nobody did. The IETF doesn\u2019t exercise the kind of power that requires it to be authorized to do what it does; it just documents consensus. As the IETF itself describes it, designation of a protocol as an Internet Standard means only that: the IETF has agreed that \u201cif you want to do this thing, this is the description of how to do it.\u201d It does not imply any attempt by the IETF to mandate its use, or any attempt to police its usage\u2014only The benefit of a standard to the Internet is in interoperability\u2014that multiple products implementing a standard are able to work together in order to deliver valuable functions to the Internet\u2019s users. Internet Standards are \u201cauthoritative\u201d and \u201cofficial\u201d not because they are promulgated by the authorized, official body, but because, and only because, and only to the extent that, everyone\u2014the hundreds of thousands of hardware manufacturers, and software developers, and Internet Service Providers who build and implement the codes built in accordance with those standards\u2014treats them as \u201cauthoritative\u201d and \u201cofficial.\u201d The rules for a common global language were developed by consensus. Consensus governance can scale. I\u2019m The very existence of \u201cthe Internet\u201d is proof that it can\u2014not in theory but in actual practice.8 Remember Montesquieu\u2019s \u201cLaw\u201d? Wrong again! Democratic governance, not just on a continental, but on a global, scale.9 Perhaps it is a coincidence that this decentralized \u201cthere-is-no-there-there\u201d process produced this decentralized \u201cthere-is-no-there-there\u201d network. There are plenty of signs that the UN and the ITU, having tried once to nip TCP/IP in the bud and failed, as it were, are at it again, seeking a much more expanded role in\u2014or even possibly control over\u2014various parts of the Internet protocol-setting process.10 Now that the Internet has become what it has become, the power to set the TCP/IP rules, at the very bottom of the stack, is immense, and I like the idea that it can be exercised only when there is a broad global consensus, among anyone interested in participating in the discussion, that it should be exercised. ICANN was born in October 1998, its birth the culmination of the first (but probably not the last) crisis in \u201cInternet governance.\u201d the one irreducible requirement for communication over the Internet: every communication must contain the recipient\u2019s IP address in order for the network to do its job\u2014its only job\u2014of routing it properly to its destination. The designers of the early versions of the TCP/IP protocols recognized this simple and obvious fact, and, after a relatively short period during which network users actually had to enter numerical addresses for all messages, by the mid-1970s they had devised a naming system that was as simple and straightforward as you can imagine. A single database file\u2014known as \u201chosts.txt,\u201d\u2014would list the name, and corresponding numerical IP Address, for each machine on the network: It was exactly like a simple telephone book\u2014names associated with numbers. Every machine on the inter-network would have its own copy of the \u201chosts.txt\u201d file. To make this system work, someone had to maintain a master copy of the hosts.txt file\u2014the Keeper of the Names and Numbers. Domain Name System, which, with some modifications, persists today. The new system had two significant new features: (1) names would be hierarchically nested within \u201cdomains,\u201d and (2) the databases associating names and IP Addresses would be distributed around the network. Hierarchical nesting works as follows. The space of all usable names is divided up into \u201cdomains.\u201d At the top are the top-level domains (or TLDs). Postel\u2019s initial specification called for seven so-called \u201cgeneric\u201d TLDs\u2014\u201cEDU,\u201d \u201cORG,\u201d \u201cCOM,\u201d \u201cMIL,\u201d \u201cNET,\u201d \u201cGOV,\u201d and \u201cINT\u201d\u2014as well as top-level domains representing individual countries (the \u201ccountry-code TLDs,\u201d or ccTLDs) that would have names in accordance with the list prepared by the International Standards Organization\u2014\u201cJP\u201d for Japan, \u201cDE\u201d for Germany, \u201cUS\u201d for the United States, etc.). Each top-level domain can contain any number of 2d-level (second-level) domains. The DNS is distributed in the sense that there is no longer a single source of information associating names with their addresses\u2014no more telephone-book-type listing all of the names on the entire inter-network, no more \u201chosts.txt\u201d file. Instead, the information associating any specific name with an IP Address is scattered in bits and pieces around the network. Each domain maintains a database of names and associated IP addresses for all domains beneath it in the hierarchy. At the very top of the whole system is what is known as the ROOT database\u2014the Ur-domain, as it were. The ROOT continues this hierarchical pattern \u201cupwards\u201d; the ROOT database lists the names and IP Addresses for all domains immediately beneath it in the hierarchy, i.e., all of the top-level domains: The answer to the question \u201cWho is going to keep track of all of the names and IP Addresses as the network gets bigger?\u201d would be: Nobody! Instead, \u201cpointers\u201d would be distributed around the network to resolve address queries\u2014the By virtue of the structure of the DNS, the ability to modify (or to refuse to modify) the root zone files in the root servers carries with it considerable power. The power to control the root servers is the power to decide (1) which top-level domains are visible in the name space and (2) which name servers are authoritative for those top-level domains\u2014that is, which entities get to say who controls the various second-level domains in that top-level domain. The top-level domains\u2014.COM, .ORG, .JP, .DE and all the rest\u2014exist only because the ROOT says they exist\u2014because there is a listing in the ROOT file for each of them. They don\u2019t really disappear, of course; the physical machines continue to exist, and those machines remain connected, physically, to other machines on the inter-network; but there\u2019s no way for those other machines on the network to find them, or to get messages to them\u2014so for all intents and purposes they have ceased to exist on the Internet. The U.S. government owned the machine\u2014the \u201cA\u201d root server\u2014on which the ROOT file had always been stored, so it, presumably, had the right to do what it wished with the ROOT file. That was clear enough. What was not clear was whether the government \u201cowned\u201d the ROOT, in the sense of having the exclusive right to make changes in the ROOT. These \u201cDNS Wars,\u201d as they\u2019ve been called, constituted a crisis of \u201cgovernance\u201d because the hard questions were all, ultimately, of the form: Who decides? Who decides what\u2019s in the ROOT? the hard Internet governance question is not \u201cwho decides?\u201d but \u201cwho decides who decides?\u201d The DNS is, when all is said and done, just a linguistic device, a way to give names to things. Coordination is great, to be sure; but you can get coordination without control. Otherwise, you destroy its copiousness. The system will converge because it is consensus-based\u2014and if there\u2019s no consensus about things, why should we impose one? [C]oordination of the root server network is necessary if the whole system is to work smoothly. While day-to-day operational tasks, such as the actual operation and maintenance of the Internet root servers, can be dispersed, overall policy guidance and control of the TLDs and the Internet root server system should be vested in a single organization. All those \u201cwho decides?\u201d questions would now have a different answer: ICANN decides. But whatever you call it, it looks a lot like law: it defines rights and obligations between parties who have conflicting claims to resources, it specifies a procedure for making judgments (hopefully, fair ones) in individual cases, and it has a mechanism for enforcing those judgments. The UDRP operates directly on the thing itself that the parties are fighting over\u2014in this case, the database entry.10 Its orders are enforced by changing that entry (or not, as the case may be), and all relevant parties have promised, through the web of ICANN-initiated contracts, to take the steps necessary to comply with the UDRP decisions. Contract-based governance. It applies only on the inter-network\u2014but everywhere on the inter-network, because it operates so far down in the protocol stack. It only covers a thin slice\u2014a very thin slice\u2014of the universe of inter-network legal disputes: only those disputes between trademark holders and domain name registrants over rights to their names. Thin, but wide; wherever you live, wherever, and from whomever, you obtained your domain name, the UDRP can be brought to bear on to determine whether you get to keep it. It\u2019s a strange new kind of law, and a strange new kind of lawmaking process, ICANN has a kind of gatekeeper power, the power to decide who gets in and who doesn\u2019t, the power to make machines vanish from the inter-network\u2014and that should make us all a little bit nervous. Gatekeeper power is the power to place conditions on participation in inter-network activities. Which is why perhaps it does matter whether we call what ICANN makes \u201claw\u201d or not. If we call it \u201claw,\u201d more people will pay attention to it than if we call it \u201cdatabase management,\u201d and there will be more public discussion and debate and dialogue about what ICANN is and what it is doing. governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed Code may be law in cyberspace, but law\u2014ordinary law, the rules contained in the statutes and ordinances and municipal regulations and constitutions and court decisions and all the rest\u2014is also law in cyberspace. The tricky part, though, is: Which law? Whose law? The international legal system is premised, at bottom, on the existence and mutual recognition of the physical boundaries that separate sovereign and independent lawmaking communities\u2014nation-states\u2014from one another. These boundaries matter, in that system, and they matter a great deal. But on the inter-network, information moves in ways that seem to pay scant regard to those boundaries, and mapping them onto network activity is a profoundly difficult challenge. The realm of conflict of laws is a dismal swamp, filled with quaking quagmires, and inhabited by learned but eccentric professors who theorize about mysterious matters in a strange and incomprehensible jargon. The ordinary court, or lawyer, is quite lost when engulfed and entangled in it. PROF. WILLIAM PROSSER Wars have been fought over seemingly arcane questions of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d\u2014our own Revolutionary War among them\u2014because seemingly arcane questions of jurisdiction are, at bottom, questions about who gets to make law for whom, and questions about who gets to make law for whom raise fundamental questions of power and order and right. One of those well-settled principles permits nations to regulate conduct occurring outside their borders\u2014\u201cextraterritorial conduct\u201d\u2014if that conduct has \u201csignificant effects\u201d within those borders: A nation can purport to regulate activity that takes place anywhere. The Island of Tobago can enact a law that purports to bind the rights of the whole world. But the effective scope of this law depends on Tobago\u2019s ability to enforce it. And in general a nation can only enforce its laws against: (i) persons with a presence or assets in the nation\u2019s territory; (ii) persons over whom the nation can obtain personal jurisdiction and enforce a default judgment against abroad; or (iii) persons whom the nation can successfully extradite. A defendant\u2019s physical presence or assets within the territory remains the primary basis for a nation or state to enforce its laws. The large majority of persons who transact in cyberspace have no presence or assets in the jurisdictions that wish to regulate their information flows in cyberspace.\u2026 [F]or almost all users, there will be no threat of extra-territorial legal liability because of a lack of presence in the regulating jurisdictions. So as long as you keep yourself, and your assets, out of Brazil, and Japan, and Kenya, you don\u2019t really have to worry about the ever-present, but entirely theoretical, problem of being hauled into a Brazilian, or Japanese, or Kenyan courtroom and forced to defend yourself against a charge arising out of something appearing on your website. It\u2019s a strange kind of law being served up by the Unexceptionalists\u2014law that only gets revealed to the interacting parties ex post facto, and which can therefore no longer guide the behavior of those subject to it in any meaningful way.3 Stripped of all technicalities, [the rule of law means] that governments are constrained by rules, fixed and announced beforehand, which make it possible to foresee with fair certainty how the authority will use its coercive powers in given circumstances and to plan one\u2019s individual affairs on the basis of this knowledge. There is one obvious and straightforward \u201csolution\u201d to the Yahoo! Problem, but it is one that few people on either side of this debate think much of: international harmonization, a single global law for \u201chate speech,\u201d or copyright, or fraud, or libel, or pornography, or consumer protection, or data privacy, or what-have-you. If the nations of the world were to agree, by treaty or some other multilateral act, to such law, the Yahoo! Problem disappears; no more conflicts between the laws of different jurisdictions, no more concerns about the difficulties of complying with 175 different legal regimes. Global law for a global Internet. People with different values disagree about the type of information they want to receive and the type of information they deem harmful. The advantage of decentralized governance is that it can better reflect differences among peoples.\u2026 A more fundamental problem is that the global norms would often be unattractive, even if they could be enforced. When you choose a single rule for six billion people, odds are that several billion, or more, will be unhappy with it. it\u2019s all just people in one place interacting and communicating with other people in other places. So why not begin by recognizing their right\u2014perhaps even their inalienable right?\u2014to govern themselves as they see fit? Why not let those who choose to enter, and to interact within, these online communities make their own law, deciding for themselves how they\u2019d like to order their affairs? there\u2019s a \u201cplace-ness\u201d to these virtual places\u2014not just in the way they look but in the way they persist through time, and in the way they present opportunities for an infinite variety of repeated interactions between individuals, for collective decision-making, and for common enterprise\u2014that enables us to think about them and talk about them the way that the people who spend lots of time there often do: as true communities, with shared norms and customs and expectations characteristic of each and continually being created and re-created by the members within each. I doesn\u2019t seem so crazy to me to begin the conversation about Chiaretta Charron\u2019s scheme not by asking \u201chow can we apply the law of 175 or so sovereign states simultaneously to this transaction?\u201d but by asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the law of the place where the transaction is taking place?\u201d That is, to be sure, just the beginning of the conversation. At the moment, there is no law of the place\u2014nothing that can fairly be called \u201cSecond Life law\u201d or \u201cThere. com law\u201d or \u201cLineage II law\u201d\u2014because no institutions or processes for making \u201claw\u201d have been developed in any of these virtual worlds. They are, at the moment, truly lawless places\u2014or, more precisely, places where code, and only code, is law. \u201claw entrepreneurs\u201d who will seize on this problem and get to work; I just wish the Unexceptionalists would stop telling us that we don\u2019t, that we\u2019ve somehow given up our right to create new communities and to live under law of our own devising, or that we\u2019ve somehow finished designing legal institutions and are stuck, forevermore, with the ones we happen to have come up with by 1995. Law, like many other important social phenomena\u2014money, for instance\u2014has a strange, self-fulfilling element to it: its existence depends on people believing that it exists. To become a lawmaking community, participants must believe that they\u2019re in a lawmaking community. If everyone believes that \u201creal law\u201d from \u201creal sovereigns\u201d is the only law that matters (or can ever matter)\u2014that no matter what steps they take to set up a fair and reasonable system for resolving virtual world disputes in accordance with newly created virtual world law, their efforts will come to nothing because they can\u2019t create \u201creal law\u201d\u2014then \u201creal law\u201d from \u201creal sovereigns\u201d will be the only law that matters, Any system of laws applicable to Internet activities, wherever it comes from and whoever creates it and enforces it, must address two great and complex issues central to any legal order in cyberspace: first, where to draw the line between permissible and impermissible speech (a question of First Amendment law, in the United States) and, second, how much legal protection to provide for \u201cintellectual property.\u201d were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter. To preserve the freedom of the human mind & freedom of the press, every spirit should be ready to devote itself to martyrdom; for as long as we may think as we will, & speak as we think, the condition of man will proceed in improvement. The true foundation of republican government is the equal right of every citizen in his person and his property, and in their management. It is honorable for us to have produced the first legislature who had the courage to declare that the reason of man may be trusted with the formation of his own opinions [and] that man may be governed by reason and truth. Our first object should therefore be, to leave open to him all the avenues to truth. Freedom of discussion, unaided by power, is sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth. It is error alone which needs the support of government. Truth can stand by itself. The legitimate powers of government extend only to such acts as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbour to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. The right to speak and to think as we wish is a \u201cnatural right\u201d; it is neither given to us by law, nor derived from law, but antecedent to law\u2014lower down in the protocol stack, if you will, than law. A right of free correspondence between citizen and citizen on their joint interests \u2026 under whatever laws these interests arise (of the State, of Congress, of France, Spain, or Turkey), is a natural right. It is not the gift of law, either of England, or Virginia, or of Congress, but, in common with all our other natural rights, it is one of the objects for the protection of which society is formed and law established. The most effectual means of preventing the perversion of power into tyranny is to illuminate as far as possible the minds of the people. To a Jeffersonian, then, free speech questions are always simultaneously (a) of supreme importance and (b) pretty easy. The answer to free speech questions is always (or almost always) simple: The more protection for, and the fewer the restrictions on, speech, the better. Lay down true principles, and adhere to them inflexibly. In Jefferson\u2019s view, intellectual property rights\u2014the rights to exclude others from using or selling or copying the products of the human imagination, whether that\u2019s the chemical formula for a new drug to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the design of a new mousetrap, or the lyrics to \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d\u2014are the \u201cgift of social law.\u201d That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature when she made them, like the air we breathe, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation, and, like fire, expansible over all space without lessening their density in any point. An individual may exclusively possess an idea, but only as long as he keeps it to himself. The moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Their peculiar character is that no one possesses them the less because others possess the whole; he who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mine, [just] as he who lights his [candle] at mine receives light without darkening me. Unlike free speech rights, intellectual property thus cannot, in nature, be a subject of property; they do derive from the \u201csocial law,\u201d from the laws of England, or Virginia, or wherever; they\u2019re not antecedent to the law, but entirely dependent on it. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t have intellectual property rights. It only means that we get to decide (and we have to decide) whether to have them or not, and how much of them to have. Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility. The benefit side is easy to see and to appreciate. We give creators and inventors of new things\u2014new farm implements, new poems, new kinds of cement, new songs\u2014property rights (patents or copyrights) in their creations because that will stimulate the creation of still more new things. Absent that protection\u2014in nature, as it were\u2014should you come up with a new and better plow design there would be no way for you to stop others from copying and manufacturing and selling it; you\u2019re therefore unlikely to invest the time and effort and resources necessary to create the new design in the first place. At some point, as intellectual property rights get stronger, covering more kinds of things, or covering them for longer periods of time, they can become too strong, and they can choke off creativity rather than stimulate it. Today\u2019s inventors and creators\u2014plow designers and songwriters alike\u2014are always building upon and borrowing from yesterday\u2019s creations and inventions. The stronger the property rights given to yesterday\u2019s creations and inventions, the more difficult and costly that building-upon and borrowing process becomes for today\u2019s creators and inventors, who have to obtain permission, or pay a licensing fee, in order to use patented or copyrighted creations and inventions (or risk a lawsuit if they do not).12 the price we pay (tomorrow) for the intellectual property protection we bestow (today): We restrict\u2014purposefully and intentionally\u2014the freedom of future creators and inventors to borrow from and build upon what they find around them, in the hopes of increasing creative Tomorrow\u2019s creators and inventors are still better off\u2014or at least they are no worse off\u2014having to obtain permission, or pay a fee, to use/copy/borrow those creations and inventions, because those creations and inventions wouldn\u2019t even exist without the promise of property protection in the first place. Intellectual property law in a Jeffersonian world, then, is always a matter of degree, of finding that balance, of drawing the line, as he put it, between the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent and those which are not. The perfect Jeffersonian world, then, is one that has as much protection for speech as it can have, but only as much protection The perfect Jeffersonian world, then, is one that has as much protection for speech as it can have, but only as much protection for intellectual property as it needs. freedom of discussion is sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth, place with so little intellectual property protection spawned such an extraordinary explosion of creative activity. The Internet should be a barren wasteland, if we truly needed copyright incentives to stimulate our collective creative juices. But it isn\u2019t. We need, more than answers to today\u2019s questions about law and policy on the network, new ways of thinking about the questions themselves, new vocabularies, new visions of the possible, new ways of identifying and organizing what we know and what we don\u2019t know about the new place. \u201cThe strange thing about cyberspace,\u201d Lessig wrote, is that \u201cit is said to have a nature.\u201d We are building the most important jurisdiction since the Louisiana Purchase,\u2026 and here\u2019s the central point: This space\u2014this space that cyberspace is\u2014this space is constituted by its code.

The architecture, the design, the constitution, the shape\u2014these features that someone, some code writer, builds. This architecture makes cyberspace as it is, and this architecture can be different.\u2026 The nature of this space is not determined by god; the nature of this space is ours to set. Whether, in Jefferson\u2019s words, ideas will be free to flow is a decision we must make, not a decision that nature has made. Whether one may travel in this space with the right of anonymity is a choice that we must make, not a choice that the nature of the space will assure. The space has the nature that its code writers give it; yet we are the code writers, and we can do things differently. \u201cVis-\u00e0-vis the laws of nature in this new space,\u201d Lessig went on, \u201cwe are gods; and the problem with being gods is that we must choose.\u201d We stand on the edge of an era when fundamental choices about what life in cyberspace, and therefore, life in real space, will be like.

He said that at dusk the process is reversed and that plants actually emit small amounts of light. He referred to sap as the green blood of plants, explaining that chlorophyll is structurally almost the same as the pigment of our blood, only the iron in hemoglobin is replaced by magnesium in plants. He spoke of the way plants grow, a seed of grass producing sixty miles of root hairs in a day, six thousand miles over the course of a season; a field of hay exhaling five hundred tons of water into the air each day; a flower pushing its blossom through three inches of pavement; a single catkin of a birch tree producing five million grains of pollen; a tree living for four thousand years.

While presenting itself as a post-Judaic, New Age Buddhism, this spirituality re-insinuates the most remorseless protestantism. It burdens the individual soul with an inner predestination: you have eternal life only if you dissolve the difficulty of living, of love, of self and other, of the other in the self, if you are translucid, without inner or outer boundaries. If you lead a normally unhappy life, you are predestined to eternal damnation, you will not live. This is the counsel of despair which would keep the mind out of hell. The tradition is far kinder in its understanding that to live, to love, is to be failed, to forgive, to have failed, to be forgiven, for ever and ever. Keep your mind in hell, and despair not.

Quotidie morimur et tamem nos esse aeternos putamus (We die every day and therefore we consider ourselves to be immortal). This unrevealed religion is the baroque excrescence of the Protestant ethic: hedonist, not ascetic, voluptuous, not austere, embellished, not plain, it devotes us to our own individual, inner-worldly authority, but with the loss of the inner as well as the outer mediator.

It is something to show that the consistency of a system requires a particular result, but it is not all. The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience The law embodies the story of a nation\u2019s development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics. The substance of the law at any given time pretty nearly corresponds, so far as it goes, with what is then understood to be convenient; but its form and machinery, and the degree to which it is able to work out desired results, depend very much upon its past. Many things which we take for granted have had to be laboriously fought out or thought out in past times. It may be assumed that the earliest barbarian whose practices are to be considered, had a good many of the same feelings and passions as ourselves. the early forms of legal procedure were grounded in vengeance. The feud led to the composition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the feud wasbought off. as the compensation recovered in the appeal was the alternative of vengeance, we might expect to find its scope limited to the scope of vengeance. Vengeance imports a feeling of blame, and an opinion, however distorted by passion, that a wrong has been done. It can hardly go very far beyond the case of a harm intentionally inflicted: even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked. Whether for this cause or another, the early English appeals for personal violence seem to have been confined to intentional wrongs. was only at a later day, and after argument, that trespass was extended so as to embrace harms which were foreseen, but which were not the intended consequence of the defendant\u2019s act. Thence again it extended to unforeseen injuries. Our system of private liability for the consequences of a man\u2019s own acts, that is, for his trespasses, started from the notion of actual intent and actual personal culpability. The original principles of liability for harm inflicted by another person or thing have been less carefully considered hitherto than those which governed trespass, and I shall therefore devote the rest of this Lecture to discussing them. I shall try to show that this liability also had its root in the passion of revenge, and to point out the changes by which it reached its present form. The customs, beliefs, or needs of a primitive time establish a rule or a formula. The customs, beliefs, or needs of a primitive time establish a rule or a formula. In the course of centuries the custom, belief, or necessity disappears, but the rule remains. The customs, beliefs, or needs of a primitive time establish a rule or a formula. In the course of centuries the custom, belief, or necessity disappears, but the rule remains. The reason which gave rise to the rule has been forgotten, and ingenious minds set themselves to inquire how it is to be accounted for. Some ground of policy is thought of, which seems to explain it and to reconcile it with the present state of things; and then the rule adapts itself to the new reasons which have been found for it, and enters on a new career. The old form receives a new content, and in time even the form modifies itself to fit the meaning which it has received. All this shows very clearly that the liability of the owner was merely a way of getting at the slave or animal which was the immediate cause of offence. In other words, vengeance on the immediate offender was the object of the Greek and early Roman process, not indemnity from the master or owner. The hatred for anything giving us pain, which wreaks itself on the manifest cause, and which leads even civilized man to kick a door when it pinches his finger, is embodied in the noxoe deditio and other kindred doctrines of early Roman law. it may be asked how inanimate objects came to be pursued in this way, if the object of the procedure was to gratify the passion of revenge. Learned men have been ready to find a reason in the personification of inanimate nature common to savages and children, and there is much to confirm this view. Without such a personification, anger towards lifeless things would have been transitory, at most. In the Athenian process there is also, no doubt, to be traced a different thought. Expiation is one of the ends most insisted on by Plato, liability may sometimes be escaped by giving up even the dead body of the offender. It might be asked what analogy could have been found between a breach of contract and those wrongs which excite the desire for vengeance. But it must be remembered that the distinction between tort and breaches of contract, and especially between the remedies for the two, is not found ready made. It is conceivable that a procedure adapted to redress for violence was extended to other cases as they arose. Slaves were surrendered for theft as well as for assault; and it is said that a debtor who did not pay his debts, or a seller who failed to deliver an article for which he had been paid, was dealt with on the same footing as a thief. This line of thought, together with the quasi material conception of legal obligations as binding the offending body, which has been noticed, would perhaps explain the well-known law of the Twelve Tables as to insolvent debtors. According to that law, if a man was indebted to several creditors and insolvent, after certain formalities they might cut up his body and divide it among them. The desire for vengeance may be felt as strongly against a slave as against a freeman, and it is not without example nowadays that a like passion should be felt against an animal. The surrender of the slave or beast empowered the injured party to do his will upon them. Payment by the owner was merely a privilege in case he wanted to buy the vengeance off. What had been the privilege of buying off vengeance by agreement, of paying the damage instead of surrendering the body of the offender, no doubt became a general custom. ship-owners and innkeepers were made liable as if they were wrong-doers for wrongs committed by those in their employ on board ship or in the tavern, although of course committed without their knowledge. some of the jurists, who regarded the surrender of children and slaves as a privilege intended to limit liability, explained this new liability on the ground that the innkeeper or ship-owner was to a certain degree guilty of negligence in having employed the services of bad men? The reason given for it was of general application, and the principle expanded to the scope of the reason. For the first time one man was made answerable for the wrongs of another who was also answerable himself, and who had a standing before the law. here we have the history of the whole modern doctrine of master and servant, and principal and agent. All servants are now as free and as liable to a suit as their masters. Yet the principle introduced on special grounds in a special case, when servants were slaves, is now the general law of this country and England, here we have the history of the whole modern doctrine of master and servant, and principal and agent. All servants are now as free and as liable to a suit as their masters. Yet the principle introduced on special grounds in a special case, when servants were slaves, is now the general law of this country and England, and under it men daily have to pay large sums for other people\u2019s acts, in which they had no part and for which they are in no sense to blame. here we have the history of the whole modern doctrine of master and servant, and principal and agent.

And to this day the reason offered by the Roman jurists for an exceptional rule is made to justify this universal and unlimited responsibility. The earlier liability for slaves and animals was mainly confined to surrender; the later became personal, as at Rome. \u201cIf a tiger killed a Kuki, his family were in disgrace till they had retaliated by killing and eating this tiger, or another; but further, if a man was killed by a fall from a tree, his relatives would take their revenge by cutting the tree down, and scattering it in chips.\u201d the later laws, from about a hundred years after Alfred down to the collection known as the laws of Henry I, compiled long after the Conquest, increase the lord\u2019s liability for his household, and make him surety for his men\u2019s good conduct. Nowadays a man is bound at his peril to keep his cattle from trespassing, and he is liable for damage done by his dog or by any fierce animal, if he has notice of a tendency in the brute to do the harm complained of. The question is whether any connection can be established between these very sensible and intelligible rules of modern law and the surrender directed by King Alfred. Gif ane lord hes ane milne, and any man fall in the damne, and be borne down with the water quhill he comes to the quheill, and there be slaine to death with the quheill; quhither aught the milne to be eseheir or not? The law sayes thereto nay, and be this reason, For it is ane dead thing, and ane dead thing may do na fellony, nor be made escheit throw their gilt. Swa the milne in this case is not culpable, and in the law it is lawfull to the lord of the land to haue ane mylne on his awin water quhere best likes him.\u201d a distinction is taken between things which are capable of guilt and those which are not,\u2014between living and dead things; but he will also see that no difficulty was felt in treating animals as guilty. Take next an early passage of the English law, a report of what was laid down by one of the English judges. In 1333 it was stated for law, that, \u201cif my dog kills your sheep, and I, freshly after the fact, tender you the dog, you are without recovery against me.\u201d the ground of the owner\u2019s liability was his ownership of the offending: thing and his failure to surrender it. one ground on which a man is bound at his peril to restrain cattle from trespassing is that he has valuable property in such animals, whereas he has not dogs, for which his responsibility is less. To this day, in fact, cautious judges state the law as to cattle to be, that, \u201cif I am the owner of an animal in which by law the right of property can exist, I am bound to take care that it does Lord Holt, near the beginning of the last century, to intimate that one ground on which a man is bound at his peril to restrain cattle from trespassing is that he has valuable property in such animals, whereas he has not dogs, for which his responsibility is less. To this day, in fact, cautious judges state the law as to cattle to be, that, \u201cif I am the owner of an animal in which by law the right of property can exist, I am bound to take care that it does not stray into the land of my neighbor.\u201d I do not mean that our modern law on this subject is only a survival, and that the only change from primitive notions was to substitute the owner for the offending animal. For although it is probable that the early law was one of the causes which led to the modern doctrine, there has been too much good sense in every stage of our law to adopt any such sweeping consequences as would follow from the wholesale transfer of liability supposed. An owner is not bound at his peril to keep his cattle from harming his neighbor\u2019s person. And in some of the earliest instances of personal liability, even for trespass on a neighbor\u2019s land, the ground seems to have been the owner\u2019s negligence. It is the nature of those animals which the common law recognizes as the subject of ownership to stray, and when straying to do damage by trampling down and eating crops. At the same time it is usual and easy to restrain them. On the other hand, a dog, which is not the subject of property, does no harm by simply crossing the land of others than its owner. Hence to this extent the new law might have followed the old. The right of property in the offending animal, which was the ancient ground of responsibility, might have been adopted safely enough as the test of a liability based on the fault of the owner. But the responsibility for damage of a kind not to be expected from such animals is determined on grounds of policy comparatively little disturbed by tradition. The development of personal liability for fierce wild animals at Rome has been explained. Our law seems to have followed the Roman. escheat animals which the Scotch law forfeited were escheat to the king. The same thing has remained true in England until well into this century, with regard even to inanimate objects. in case a man was slain, the coroner was to value the object causing the death, and that was to be forfeited sa deodand \u201cpro rege.\u201d It was to be given to God, that is to say to the Church, for the king, to be expended for the good of his soul. it has been repeated from Queen Elizabeth\u2019s time to within one hundred years, that if my horse strikes a man, and afterwards I sell my horse, and after that the man dies, the horse shall be forfeited it is, that, in all indictments for homicide, until very lately it has been necessary to state the instrument causing the death and its value, as that the stroke was given by a certain penknife, value it is, that, in all indictments for homicide, until very lately it has been necessary to state the instrument causing the death and its value, as that the stroke was given by a certain penknife, value sixpence, so as to secure the forfeiture. A maxim of Henry Spigurnel, a judge in the time of Edward I., is reported, that \u201cwhere a man is killed by a cart, or by the fall of a house, or in other like manner, and the thing in motion is the cause of the death, it shall be deodand.\u201d motion gives life to the object forfeited. It is only by supposing the ship to have been treated as if endowed with personality, that the arbitrary seeming peculiarities of the maritime law can be made intelligible, and on that supposition they at once become consistent and logical. It may be admitted that, if this doctrine were not supported by an appearance of good sense, it would not have survived. The ship is the only security available in dealing with foreigners, and rather than send one\u2019s own citizens to search for a remedy abroad in strange courts, it is easy to seize the vessel and satisfy the claim at home, leaving the foreign owners to get their indemnity as they may be able. I \u201cThis is not a proceeding against the owner; it is a proceeding against the vessel for an offence committed by the vessel; \u201cThe thing is here primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence is primarily attached to the thing.\u201d those great judges, although of course aware that a ship is no more alive than a mill-wheel, thought that not only the law did in fact deal with it as if it were alive, but that it was reasonable that the law should do so. By the maritime law of the Middle Ages the ship was not only the source, but the limit, of liability. \u201cThe ship is the debtor,\u201d as was said in arguing a case decided in the time of William III. If the debtor perished, there was an end of the matter. If a part came ashore, that might be proceeded against. freight is the mother of wages, at the vessel was bound by the contract with the sailors, much in the same way as it was by the wrongs for which it was answerable, just as the debtor\u2019s body was answerable for his debts, as well as for his the vessel was bound by the contract with the sailors, much in the same way as it was by the wrongs for which it was answerable, just as the debtor\u2019s body was answerable for his debts, as well as for his crimes, under the ancient law of Rome. \u201cBy custom the ship is bound to the merchandise, and the merchandise to the ship.\u201d the vessel was not only the security for the debt, but the limit of the owner\u2019s liability. The principles of the admiralty are embodied in its form of procedure. A suit may be brought there against a vessel by name, any person interested in it being at liberty to come in and defend, but the suit, if successful, ending in a sale of the vessel and a payment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim out of the proceeds. We have now followed the development of the chief forms of liability in modern law for anything other than the immediate and manifest consequences of a man\u2019s own acts. We have seen the parallel course of events in the two parents,\u2014the Roman law and the German customs, and in the offspring of those two on English soil with regard to servants, animals, and inanimate things. We have seen a single germ multiplying and branching into products as different from each other as the flower from the root. It hardly remains to ask what that germ was. We have seen that it was the desire of retaliation against the offending thing itself. A consideration of the earliest instances will show, as might have been expected, that vengeance, not compensation, and vengeance on the offending thing, was the original object. The foregoing history, apart from the purposes for which it has been given, well illustrates the paradox of form and substance in the development of law. In form its growth is logical. The official theory is that each new decision follows syllogistically from existing precedents. But just as the clavicle in the cat only tells of the existence of some earlier creature to which a collar-bone was useful, precedents survive in the law long after the use they once served is at an end and the reason for them has been forgotten. The very considerations which judges most rarely mention, and always with an apology, are the secret root from which the law draws all the juices of life. I mean, of course, considerations of what is expedient for the community concerned. The very considerations which judges most rarely mention, and always with an apology, are the secret root from which the law draws all the juices of life. I mean, of course, considerations of what is expedient for the community concerned. Every important principle which is developed by litigation is in fact and at bottom the result of more or less definitely understood views of public policy; the law is administered by able and experienced men, who know too much to sacrifice good sense to a syllogism, it will be found that, when ancient rules maintain themselves in the way that has been and will be shown in this book, new reasons more fitted to the time have been found for them, and that they gradually receive a new content, and at last a new form, from the grounds to which they have been transplanted. But hitherto this process has been largely unconscious. It is important, on that account, to bring to mind what the actual course of events has been. If it were only to insist on a more conscious recognition of the legislative function of the courts, as just explained, What has been said will explain the failure of all theories which consider the law only from its formal side; whether they attempt to deduce the corpus from a priori postulates, or fall into the humbler error of supposing the science of the law to reside in the elegantia juris, or logical cohesion of part with part. The truth is, that the law always approaching, and never reaching, consistency. What has been said will explain the failure of all theories which consider the law only from its formal side; whether they attempt to deduce the corpus from a priori postulates, or fall into the humbler error of supposing the science of the law to reside in the elegantia juris, or logical cohesion of part with part. The truth is, that the law always approaching, and never reaching, consistency. It is forever adopting new principles from life at one end, and it always retains old ones from history at the other, which have not yet been absorbed or sloughed off. It will become entirely consistent only when it ceases to grow. However much we may codify the law into a series of seemingly self-sufficient propositions, those propositions will be but a phase in a continuous growth. To understand their scope fully, to know how they will be dealt with by judges trained in the past which the law embodies, we must ourselves know something of that past. The history of what the law has been is necessary to the knowledge of what the law is. My aim and purpose have been to show that the various forms of liability known to modern law spring from the common ground of revenge. The desire for vengeance imports an opinion that its object is actually and personally to blame. It certainly may be argued, with some force, that it has never ceased to be one object of punishment to satisfy the desire for vengeance. pain can be inflicted upon the wrong-doer, of a sort which does not restore the injured party to his former situation, or to another equally good, but which is inflicted for the very purpose of causing pain. And so far as this punishment takes the place of compensation, \u201cThe criminal law stands to the passion of revenge in much the same relation as marriage to the sexual appetite.\u201d The first requirement of a sound body of law is, that it should correspond with the actual feelings and demands of the community, whether right or wrong. If people would gratify the passion of revenge outside of the law, if the law did not help them, the law has no choice but to satisfy the craving itself, and thus avoid the greater evil of private retribution. At the same time, this passion is not one which we encourage, either as private individuals or as lawmakers. Moreover, it does not cover the whole ground. There are crimes which do not excite it, and we should naturally expect that the most important purposes of punishment would be coextensive with the whole field of its application. It remains to be discovered whether such a general purpose exists, and if so what it is. Different theories still divide opinion upon the subject. It has been thought that the purpose of punishment is to reform the criminal; that it is to deter the criminal and others from committing similar crimes; and that it is retribution. Few would now maintain that the first of these purposes was the only one. If it were, every prisoner should be released as soon as it appears clear that he will never repeat his offence, and if he is incurable he should not be punished at all. Of course it would be hard to reconcile the punishment of death with this doctrine. The main struggle lies between the other two. On the one side is the notion that there is a mystic bond between wrong and punishment; on the other, that the infliction of pain is only a means to an end. is objected that the preventive theory is immoral, because it overlooks the ill-desert of wrong-doing, and furnishes no measure of the amount of punishment, except the lawgiver\u2019s subjective opinion in regard to the sufficiency of the amount of preventive suffering. In the language of Kant, it treats man as a thing, not as a person; as a means, not as an end in himself. It is said to conflict with the sense of justice, and to violate the fundamental principle of all free communities, that the members of such communities have equal rights to life, liberty, and personal security. In spite of all this, probably most English-speaking lawyers would accept the preventive theory without hesitation. As to the violation of equal rights which is charged, it may be replied that the dogma of equality makes an equation between individuals only, not between an individual and the community. No society has ever admitted that it could not sacrifice individual welfare to its own existence. it might be suggested that the dogma of equality applied even to individuals only within the limits of ordinary dealings in the common run of affairs. the ultima ratio, not only regum, but of private persons, is force, and that at the bottom of all private relations, however tempered by sympathy and all the social feelings, is a justifiable self-preference. If a man is on a plank in the deep sea which will only float one, and a stranger lays hold of it, he will thrust him off if he can. When the state finds itself in a similar position, it does the same thing. The considerations which answer the argument of equal rights also answer the objections to treating man as a thing, and the like. If a man lives in society, he is liable to find himself so treated. The degree of civilization which a people has reached, no doubt, is marked by their anxiety to do as they would be done by. It may be the destiny of man that the social instincts shall grow to control his actions absolutely, even in anti-social situations. But they have not yet done so, and as the rules of law are or should be based upon a morality which is generally accepted, no rule founded on a theory of absolute unselfishness can be laid down without a breach between law and working beliefs. If punishment stood on the moral grounds which are proposed for it, the first thing to be considered would be those limitations in the capacity for choosing rightly which arise from abnormal instincts, want of education, lack of intelligence, and all the other defects which are most marked in the criminal classes. There remains to be mentioned the affirmative argument in favor of the theory of retribution, to the effect that the fitness of punishment following wrong-doing is axiomatic, and is instinctively recognized by unperverted minds. The feeling of fitness seems to me to be only vengeance in disguise, and I have already admitted that vengeance was an element, though not the chief element, of punishment. Prevention would accordingly seem to be the chief and only universal purpose of punishment. The law threatens certain pains if you do certain things, intending thereby to give you a new motive for not doing them. If this is a true account of the law as it stands, the law does undoubtedly treat the individual as a means to an end, and uses him as a tool to increase the general welfare at his own expense. Further evidence that our law exceeds the limits of retribution, and subordinates consideration of the individual to that of the public well-being, will be found in some doctrines which cannot be satisfactorily explained on any other ground. the deliberate taking of life will not be punished when it is the only way of saving one\u2019s own. that is the law, it must go on one of two grounds, either that self-preference is proper in the case supposed, or that, even if it is improper, the law cannot prevent it by punishment, because a threat of death at some future time can never be a sufficiently powerful motive to make a man choose death now in order to avoid the threat. Ignorance of the law is no excuse for breaking it. The principle cannot be explained by saying that we are not only commanded to abstain from certain acts, but also to find out that we are commanded. For if there were such a second command, it is very clear that the guilt of failing to obey it would bear no proportion to that of disobeying the principal command if known, yet the failure to know would receive the same punishment as the failure to obey the principal law. The true explanation of the rule is the same as that which accounts for the law\u2019s indifference to a man\u2019s particular temperament, faculties, and so forth. Public policy sacrifices the individual to the general good. It is desirable that the burden of all should be equal, but it is still more desirable to put an end to robbery and murder. It is no doubt true that there are many cases in which the criminal could not have known that he was breaking the law, but to admit the excuse at all would be to encourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined to make men know and obey, and justice to the individual is rightly outweighed by the larger interests on the other side of the scales. the actual state of mind accompanying a criminal act plays a different part from what is commonly supposed. For the most part, the purpose of the criminal law is only to induce external conformity to rule. whether it brings those conditions to pass immediately by the use of force, as when it protects a house from a mob by soldiers, or appropriates private property to public use, or hangs a man in pursuance of a judicial sentence, or whether it brings them about mediately through men\u2019s fears, its object is equally an external result. In directing itself against robbery or murder, for instance, its purpose is to put a stop to the actual physical taking and keeping of other men\u2019s goods, or the actual poisoning, shooting, stabbing, and otherwise putting to death of other men. If those things are not done, the law forbidding them is equally satisfied, whatever the motive. we can see more readily than before that the actual degree of personal guilt involved in any particular transgression cannot be the only element, if it is an element at all, in the liability incurred. So far from its being true, as is often assumed, that the condition of a man\u2019s heart or conscience ought to be more considered in determining criminal than civil liability, it might almost be said that it is the very opposite of truth. For civil liability, in its immediate working, is simply a redistribution of an existing loss between two individuals; and it will be argued in the next Lecture that sound policy lets losses lie where they fall, except where a special reason can be shown for interference. The most frequent of such reasons is, that the party who is charged has been to blame. when we are dealing with that part of the law which aims more directly than any other at establishing standards of conduct, we should expect there more than elsewhere to find that the tests of liability are external, and independent of the degree of evil in the particular person\u2019s motives or intentions. They take no account of incapacities, unless the weakness is so marked as to fall into well-known exceptions, such as infancy or madness. They assume that every man is as able as every other to behave as they command. If they fall on any one class harder than on another, it is on the weakest. For it is precisely to those who are most likely to err by temperament, ignorance, or folly, that the threats of the law are the most dangerous. when an act is said to be done maliciously, it is meant, not only that a wish for the harmful effect is the motive, but also that the harm is wished for its own sake, Malice, as used in common speech, includes intent, and something more. When an act is said to be done with an intent to do harm, it is meant that a wish for the harm is the motive of the act. Intent, however, is perfectly consistent with the harm being regretted as such, and being wished only as a means to something else. But when an act is said to be done maliciously, it is meant, not only that a wish for the harmful effect is the motive, but also that the harm is wished for its own sake, Malice, as used in common speech, includes intent, and something more. When an act is said to be done with an intent to do harm, it is meant that a wish for the harm is the motive of the act. Intent, however, is perfectly consistent with the harm being regretted as such, and being wished only as a means to something else. But when an act is said to be done maliciously, it is meant, not only that a wish for the harmful effect is the motive, but also that the harm is wished for its own sake, or, as Austin would say with more accuracy, for the sake of the pleasurable feeling which knowledge of the suffering caused by the act would excite. from Sir James Stephen\u2019s enumeration, that of these two elements of malice the intent alone is material to murder. Malice, in the definition of murder, has not the same meaning as in common speech, and, in view of the considerations just mentioned, it has been thought to mean criminal intention. intent again will be found to resolve itself into two things; foresight that certain consequences will follow from an act, and the wish for those consequences working as a motive which induces the act. knowledge that the act will probably cause death, that is, foresight of the consequences of the act, is enough in murder as in tort. What is foresight of consequences? It is a picture of a future state of things called up by knowledge of the present state of things, the future being viewed as standing to the present in the relation of effect to cause. The test of foresight is not what this very criminal foresaw, but what a man of reasonable prudence would have foreseen. there must be actual present knowledge of the present facts which make an act dangerous. The act is not enough by itself. All acts, taken apart from their surrounding circumstances, are indifferent to the law. Hence, it is no sufficient foundation for liability, on any sound principle, that the proximate cause of loss was an act. The reason for requiring an act is, that an act implies a choice, and that it is felt to be impolitic and unjust to make a man answerable for harm, unless he might have chosen otherwise. But the choice must be made with a chance of contemplating the consequence complained of, or else it has no bearing on responsibility for that consequence All foresight of the future, all choice with regard to any possible consequence of action, depends on what is known at the moment of choosing. An act cannot be wrong, even when done under circumstances in which it will be hurtful, unless those circumstances are or ought to be known. So far, then, as criminal liability is founded upon wrong-doing in any sense, and so far as the threats and punishments of the law are intended to deter men from bringing about various harmful results, they must be confined to cases where circumstances making the conduct dangerous were known. To make an act which causes death murder, then, the actor ought, on principle, to know, or have notice of the facts which make the act dangerous. There are certain exceptions to this principle which will be stated presently, but they have less application to murder than to some smaller statutory crimes. Ignorance of a fact and inability to foresee a consequence have the same effect on blameworthiness. in most cases, the question of knowledge is a question of the actual condition of the defendant\u2019s consciousness, the question of what he might have foreseen is determined by the standard of the prudent man, that is, by general experience. the purpose is to compel men to abstain from dangerous conduct, and not merely to restrain them from evil inclinations, the law requires them at their peril to know the teachings of common experience, just as it requires them to know the law. Subject to these explanations, it may be said that the test of murder is the degree of danger to life attending the act under the known circumstances of the case. A harmful act is only excused on the ground that the party neither did foresee, nor could with proper care have foreseen harm. If a man forcibly resists an officer lawfully making an arrest, and kills him, knowing him to be an officer, it may be murder, although no act is done which, but for his official function, would be criminal at all. So, if a man does an act with intent to commit a felony, and thereby accidentally kills another; for instance, if he fires at chickens, intending to steal them, and accidentally kills the owner, whom he does not see. If certain acts are regarded as peculiarly dangerous under certain circumstances, a legislator may make them punishable if done under these circumstances, although the danger was not generally known. The law often takes this step, although it does not nowadays often inflict death in such cases. It sometimes goes even further, and requires a man to find out present facts, as well as to foresee future harm, at his peril, although they are not such as would necessarily be inferred from the facts known. experience shows, or is deemed by the law-maker to show, that somehow or other deaths which the evidence makes accidental happen disproportionately often in connection with other felonies, or with resistance to officers, or if on any other ground of policy it is deemed desirable to make special efforts for the prevention of such deaths, the lawmaker may consistently treat acts which, under the known circumstances, are felonious, or constitute resistance to officers, as having a sufficiently dangerous tendency to be put under a special ban. The law may, therefore, throw on the actor the peril, not only of the consequences foreseen by him, but also of consequences which, although not predicted by common experience, the legislator apprehends. \u201cWhen a workman flings down a stone or piece of timber into the street, and kills a man; this may be either misadventure, manslaughter, or murder, according to the circumstances under which the original act was done: if it were in a country village, where few passengers are, and he calls out to all people to have a care, it is misadventure only; but if it were in London, or other populous town, where people are continually passing, it is manslaughter, though he gives loud warning; and murder, if he knows of their passing, and gives no warning at all.\u201d The law of manslaughter contains another doctrine which should be referred to in order to complete the understanding of the general principles of the criminal law. This doctrine is, that provocation may reduce an offence which would otherwise have been murder to manslaughter. man is not so much to blame for an act done under the disturbance of great excitement, caused by a wrong done to himself, as when he is calm. It might be urged, on the other side, that, if the object of punishment is prevention, the heaviest punishment should be threatened where the strongest motive is needed to restrain; and primitive legislation seems sometimes to have gone on that principle. But if any threat will restrain a man in a passion, a threat of less than death will be sufficient, and therefore the extreme penalty has been thought excessive. There must be provocation sufficient to justify the passion, and the law decides on general considerations what provocations are sufficient. The most insulting words are not provocation, although to this day, and still more when the law was established, many people would rather die than suffer them without action. is said that even what the law admits to be \u201cprovocation does not extenuate the guilt of homicide, unless the person provoked is at the time when he does the deed deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he has received.\u201d The only ground for not applying the general rule is, that the defendant was in such a state that he could not be expected to remember or be influenced by the fear of punishment; if he could be, the ground of exception disappears. The charge of malice aforethought in an indictment for murder has been shown not to mean a state of the defendant\u2019s mind, as is often thought, except in the sense that he knew circumstances which did in fact make his conduct dangerous. It is, in truth, an allegation like that of negligence, which asserts that the party accused did not come up to the legal standard of action under the circumstances in which he found himself, and also that there was no exceptional fact or excuse present The charge of malice aforethought in an indictment for murder has been shown not to mean a state of the defendant\u2019s mind, as is often thought, except in the sense that he knew circumstances which did in fact make his conduct dangerous. It is, in truth, an allegation like that of negligence, which asserts that the party accused did not come up to the legal standard of action under the circumstances in which he found himself, and also that there was no exceptional fact or excuse present which took the case out of the general rule. When a statute punishes the \u201cwilfully and maliciously\u201d injuring another\u2019s property maliciously is here used in its popular sense, and imports that the motive for the defendant\u2019s act was a wish to harm the owner of the property, or the thing itself, if living, as an end, and for the sake of the harm. Malice in this sense has nothing in common with the malice of murder. Statutory law need not profess to be consistent with itself, or with the theory adopted by judicial decisions. punishment must be confined to compelling external conformity to a rule of conduct, so far that it can always be avoided by avoiding or doing certain acts as required, with whatever intent or for whatever motive, still the prohibited conduct may not be hurtful unless it is accompanied by a particular state of feeling. Common disputes about property are satisfactorily settled by compensation. But every one knows that sometimes secret harm is done by neighbor to neighbor out of pure malice and spite. The damage can be paid for, but the malignity calls for revenge, and the difficulty of detecting the authors of such wrongs, which are always done secretly, affords a ground for punishment, even if revenge is thought insufficient. As soon as intent is admitted to be sufficient, the law is on the high-road to an external standard. Attempt and intent, of course, are two distinct things. Attempt and intent, of course, are two distinct things. Intent to commit a crime is not itself criminal. The law only deals with conduct. An attempt is an overt act. If an act is done of which the natural and probable effect under the circumstances is the accomplishment of a substantive crime, the criminal law, while it may properly enough moderate the severity of punishment if the act has not that effect in the particular case, can hardly abstain altogether from punishing it, on any theory. It has been argued that an actual intent is all that can give the act a criminal character in such instances. The reason for punishing any act must generally be to prevent some harm which is foreseen as likely to follow that act under the circumstances in which it is done. In most substantive crimes the ground on which that likelihood stands is the common working of natural causes as shown by experience. But when an act is punished the natural effect of which is not harmful under the circumstances, that ground alone will not suffice. The probability does not exist unless there are grounds for expecting that the act done will be followed by other acts in connection with which its effect will be harmful, although not so otherwise. But as in fact no such acts have followed, it cannot, in general, be assumed, from the mere doing of what has been done, that they would have followed if the actor had not been interrupted. They would not have followed it unless the actor had chosen, and the only way generally available to show that he would have chosen to do them is by showing that he intended to do them when he did what he did. The accompanying intent in that case renders the otherwise innocent act harmful, because it raises a probability that it will be followed by such other acts and events as will all together result in harm. The importance of the intent is not to show that the act was wicked, but to show that it was likely to be followed by hurtful consequences. When a man buys matches to fire a haystack, or starts on a journey meaning to murder at the end of it, there is still a considerable chance that he will change his mind before he comes to the point. But when he has struck the match, or cocked and aimed the pistol, there is very little chance that he will not persist to the end, and the danger becomes so great that the law steps in. With an object which could not be used innocently, the point of intervention might be put further back, The degree of apprehension may affect the decision, as well as the degree of probability that the crime will be accomplished. There is one doubtful point which should not be passed over. It has been thought that to shoot at a block of wood thinking it to be a man is not an attempt to murder, and that to put a hand into an empty pocket, intending to pick it, is not an attempt to commit larceny, although on the latter question there is a difference of opinion. The reason given is, that an act which could not have effected the crime if the actor had been allowed to follow it up to all results to which in the nature of things it could have led, cannot be an attempt to commit that crime when interrupted. It is just as impossible that that bullet under those circumstances should hit that man, as to pick an empty pocket. But there is no difficulty in saying that such an act under such circumstances is so dangerous, so far as the possibility of human foresight is concerned, that it should be punished. If a man fires at a block, no harm can possibly ensue, and no theft can be committed in an empty pocket, besides that the harm of successful theft is less than that of murder. Yet it might be said that even such things as these should be punished, in order to make discouragement broad enough and easy to understand. larceny. Under this name acts are punished which of themselves would not be sufficient to accomplish the evil which the law seeks to prevent, and which are treated as equally criminal, whether the evil has been accomplished or not. In larceny the consequences immediately flowing from the act are generally exhausted with little or no harm to the owner. Goods are removed from his possession by trespass, and that is all, when the crime is complete. But they must be permanently kept from him before the harm is done which the law seeks to prevent. A momentary loss of possession is not what has been guarded against with such severe penalties. What the law means to prevent is the loss of it wholly and forever, as is shown by the fact that it is not larceny to take for a temporary use without intending to deprive the owner of his property. If then the law punishes the mere act of taking, it punishes an act which will not of itself produce the evil effect sought to be prevented, and punishes it before that effect has in any way come to pass. The law cannot wait until the property has been used up or destroyed in other hands than the owner\u2019s, or until the owner has died, in order to make sure that the harm which it seeks to prevent has been done. the intent is an index to the external event which probably would have happened, and that, if the law is to punish at all, it must, in this case, go on probabilities, not on accomplished facts. Theft may be called an attempt to permanently deprive a man of his property, which is punished with the same severity whether successful or not. An act which does not fully accomplish the prohibited result may be made wrongful by evidence that but for some interference it would have been followed by other acts co-ordinated with it to produce that result. This can only be shown by showing intent. It may be objected to this view, that, if intent is only a makeshift which from a practical necessity takes the place of actual deprivation, it ought not to be required where the actual deprivation is wholly accomplished, provided the same criminal act produces the whole effect. The whole evil which the law seeks to prevent is the natural and manifestly certain consequence of the act under the known circumstances. if the law of larceny is consistent with the theories here maintained, the act should be passed upon according to its tendency, and the actual intent of the wrong-doer not in any way considered. The inconsistency, if there is one, seems to be explained by the way in which the law has grown. The distinctions of the common law as to theft are not those of a broad theory of legislation; they are highly technical, and very largely dependent upon history for explanation. It used to be, and sometimes still is, thought that the taking must be lucri catesa, for the sake of some advantage to the thief. The intent is therefore always necessary, and it is naturally stated in the form of a self-regarding intent. As late as 1815 the English judges stood only six to five in favor of the proposition that it was larceny to take a horse intending to kill it for no other purpose than to destroy evidence against a friend. Even that case, however, did not do away with the universality of intent as a test, for the destruction followed the taking, and it is an ancient rule that the criminality of the act must be determined by the state of things at the time of the taking, and not afterwards. the function of intent when proved appears more clearly than in theft, but it is precisely similar. It is an index to the probability of certain future acts which the law seeks to prevent. the apprehended act did follow, then it is no longer necessary to allege that the breaking and entering was with that intent. An indictment for burglary which charges that the defendant broke into a dwelling-house and stole certain property, is just as good as one which alleges that he broke in with intent to steal. In the characteristic type of substantive crime acts are rendered criminal because they are done finder circumstances in which they will probably cause some harm which the law seeks to prevent. The test of criminality in such cases is the degree of danger shown by experience to attend that act under those circumstances. In such cases the mens rea, or actual wickedness of the party, is wholly unnecessary, and all reference to the state of his consciousness is misleading if it means anything more than that the circumstances in connection with which the tendency of his act is judged are the circumstances known to him. A man must find out at his peril things which a reasonable and prudent man would have inferred from the things actually known. In some cases it may be that the consequence of the act, under the circumstances, must be actually foreseen, if it is a consequence which a prudent man would not have foreseen. The reference to the prudent man, as a standard, is the only form in which blameworthiness as such is an element of crime, and what would be blameworthy in such a man is an element;\u2014first, as a survival of true moral standards; second, because to punish what would not be blameworthy in an average member of the community would be to enforce a standard which was indefensible theoretically, and which practically was too high for that community. some cases, actual malice or intent, in the common meaning of those words, is an element in crime. But it will be found that, when it is so, it is because the act when done maliciously is followed by harmwhich would not have followed the act alone, or because the intent raises a strong probability that an act, innocent in itself, will be followed by other acts or events in connection with which it will accomplish the result sought to be prevented by the law. The object of the next two Lectures is to discover whether there is any common ground at the bottom of all liability in tort, and if so, what that ground is. The liabilities incurred by way of contract are more or less expressly fixed by the agreement of the parties concerned, those arising from a tort are independent of any previous consent of the wrong-doer to bear the loss occasioned by his act. But when A assaults or slanders his neighbor, or converts his neighbor\u2019s property, he does a harm which he has never consented to bear, and if the law makes him pay for it, the reason for doing so must be found in some general view of the conduct which every one may fairly expect and demand from every other, whether that other has agreed to it or not. In place of a theory of tort, we have a theory of trespass. The business of the law of torts is to fix the dividing lines between those cases in which a man is liable for harm which he has done, and those in which he is not. it cannot enable him to predict with certainty whether a given act under given circumstances will make him liable, because an act will rarely have that effect unless followed by damage, and for the most part, if not always, the consequences of an act are not known, it cannot enable him to predict with certainty whether a given act under given circumstances will make him liable, because an act will rarely have that effect unless followed by damage, and for the most part, if not always, the consequences of an act are not known, but only guessed at as more or less probable. The only guide for the future to be drawn from a decision against a defendant in an action of tort is that similar acts, under circumstances which cannot be distinguished except by the result from those of the defendant, are done at the peril of the actor; that if he escapes liability, it is simply because by good fortune no harm comes of his conduct in the particular event. We are to ask what are the elements, on the defendant\u2019s side, which must all be present before liability is possible, and the presence of which will commonly make him liable if damage follows. it may naturally be supposed that the risk of a man\u2019s conduct is thrown upon him as the result of some moral short-coming. But while this notion has been entertained, the extreme opposite will be found to have been a far more popular opinion;\u2014I mean the notion that a man is answerable for all the consequences of his acts, or, in other words, that he acts at his peril always, and wholly irrespective of the state of his consciousness upon the matter. there are two theories of the common-law liability for unintentional harm. The first is that of Austin, which is essentially the theory of a criminalist. According to him, the characteristic feature of law, properly so called, is a sanction or detriment threatened and imposed by the sovereign for disobedience to the sovereign\u2019s commands According to this view, broadly stated, under the common law a man acts at his peril. It may be held as a sort of set-off, that he is never liable for omissions except in consequence of some duty voluntarily undertaken. But the whole and sufficient ground for such liabilities as he does incur outside the last class is supposed to be that he has voluntarily acted, and that damage has ensued. If the act was voluntary, it is totally immaterial that the detriment which followed from it was neither intended nor due to the negligence of the actor. we must remember that the abolition of the common-law forms of pleading has not changed the rules of substantive law. Hence, although pleaders now generally allege intent or negligence, anything which would formerly have been sufficient to charge a defendant in trespass is still sufficient, notwithstanding the fact that the ancient form of action and declaration has disappeared. if no such excuse is shown, and the defendant has voluntarily acted, he must answer for the consequences, however little intended and however unforeseen. In the cases put, the plaintiff has done nothing; the defendant, on the other hand, has chosen to act. As between the two, the party whose voluntary conduct has caused the damage should suffer, rather than one who has had no share in producing it. \u201cWhen one does a thing, he is bound to do it in such a way that by his act no prejudice or damage shall be done to &c. one assaults me and I cannot escape, and I in self-defence lift my stick to strike him, and in lifting it hit a man who is behind me, in this case he shall have an action against me, yet my raising my stick was lawful in self-defence, and I hit him, me invito, &c.; and so here, &C.\u201d the law is all one in great things and small when the principal thing was not lawful, that which depends upon it was not lawful; \u201cIn all civil acts the law doth not so much regard the intent of the actor, as the loss and damage of the party suffering.\u201d the principle to be, that if the injury be done by the act of the party himself at the time, or he be the immediate cause of it, though it happen accidentally or by misfortune, yet he is answerable in trespass.\u201d It might be thought enough to cite the decisions opposed to the rule of absolute responsibility, and to show that such a rule is inconsistent with admitted doctrines and sound policy. But we may go further with profit, and inquire whether there are not strong grounds for thinking that the common law has never known such a rule, unless in that period of dry precedent which is so often to be found midway between a creative epoch and a period of solvent philosophical reaction. the same reasoning would make a defendant responsible for all damage, however remote, of which his act could be called the cause. The distinction between a direct application of force, and causing damage indirectly, or as a more remote consequence of one\u2019s act, although it may determine whether the form of action should be trespass or case, does not touch the theory of responsibility, if that theory be that a man acts at his peril. if the strict liability is to be maintained at all, it must be maintained throughout. It cannot be said that trespass is for acts alone, and case for consequences of those acts. All actions of trespass are for consequences of acts, not for the acts themselves. And some actions of trespass are for consequences more remote from the defendant\u2019s act than in other instances where the remedy would be case. An act is always a voluntary muscular contraction, and nothing else. The chain of physical sequences which it sets in motion or directs to the plaintiff\u2019s harm is no part of it, and very generally a long train of such sequences intervenes. If running a man down is a trespass when the accident can be referred to the rider\u2019s act of spurring, why is it not a tort in every case, as was argued in Vincent v. Stinehour, seeing that it can always be referred more remotely to his act of mounting and taking the horse out? the intervening events are of such a kind that no foresight could have been expected to look out for them, the defendant is not to blame for having failed to do so. The difference taken in Gibbons v. Pepper, cited above, is not between results which are and those which are not the consequences of the defendant\u2019s acts: it is between consequences which he was bound as a reasonable man to contemplate, and those which he was not. The general principle of our law is that loss from accident must lie where it falls, and this principle is not affected by the fact that a human being is the instrument of misfortune. \u201cNo case or principle can be found, or if found can be maintained, subjecting an individual to liability for an act done without fault on his part .... All the cases concede that an injury arising from inevitable accident, or, which in law or reason is the same thing, from an act that ordinary human care and foresight are unable to guard against, is but the misfortune of the sufferer, and lays no foundation for legal responsibility.\u201d The requirement of an act is the requirement that the defendant should have made a choice. The state does none of these things, however, and the prevailing view is that its cumbrous and expensive machinery ought not to be set in motion unless some clear benefit is to be derived from disturbing the status quo. State interference is an evil, where it cannot be shown to be a good. The undertaking to redistribute losses simply on the ground that they resulted from the defendant\u2019s act would not only be open to these objections, but, as it is hoped the preceding discussion has shown, to the still graver one of offending the sense of justice. Unless my act is of a nature to threaten others, unless under the circumstances a prudent man would have foreseen the possibility of harm, it is no more justifiable to make me indemnify my neighbor against the consequences, than to make me do the same thing if I had fallen upon him in a fit, or to compel me to insure him against lightning. [108 The standards of the law are standards of general application. The law takes no account of the infinite varieties of temperament, intellect, and education which make the internal character of a given act so different in different men. The law considers, in other words, what would be blameworthy in the average man, the man of ordinary intelligence and prudence, and determines liability by that. A man may have as bad a heart as he chooses, if his conduct is within the rules. What the law really forbids, and the only thing it forbids, is the act on the wrong side of the line, be that act blameworthy or otherwise. any legal standard must, in theory, be one which would apply to all men, not specially excepted, under the same circumstances The ideal average prudent man, whose equivalent the jury is taken to be in many cases, and whose culpability or innocence is the supposed test, is a constant, and his conduct under given circumstances is theoretically always the same. Finally, any legal standard must, in theory, be capable of being known. When a man has to pay damages, he is supposed to have broken the law, and he is further supposed to have known what the law was. From the time of Alfred to the present day, statutes and decisions have busied themselves with defining the precautions to be taken in certain familiar cases; that is, with substituting for the vague test of the care exercised by a prudent man, a precise one of specific acts or omissions. the tendency of the law of tort to become more and more concrete by judicial decision and by statute, does not interfere with the general doctrine maintained as to the grounds of liability. when a person brings on his lands, and collects and keeps there, anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, he must keep it in at his peril; and, if he does not do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape. Cases of this sort do not stand on the notion that it is wrong to keep cattle, or to have a reservoir of water, as might have been thought with more plausibility when fierce and useless animals only were in question. It may even be very much for the public good that the dangerous accumulation should be made (a consideration which might influence the decision in some instances, and differently in different jurisdictions); but as there is a limit to the nicety of inquiry which is possible in a trial, it may be considered that the safest way to secure care is to throw the risk upon the person who decides what precautions shall be taken. The liability for trespasses of cattle seems to lie on the boundary line between rules based on policy irrespective of fault, and requirements intended to formulate the conduct of a prudent man. it is evident that the early discussions turn on the general consideration whether the owner is or is not to blame. But they do not stop there: they go on to take practical distinctions, based on common experience. the working rules of the law had long been founded on good sense. They are so many attempts to state the duty of the bailee specifically, according to the nature of the bailment and of the object bailed. Those attempts, to be sure, were not successful, partly because they were attempts to engraft upon the native stock a branch of the Roman law which was too large to survive the process, but more especially because the distinctions attempted were purely qualitative, and were therefore useless when dealing with a jury. When a case arises in which the standard of conduct, pure and simple, is submitted to the jury, the explanation is plain. It is that the court, not entertaining any clear views of public policy applicable to the matter, derives the rule to be applied <You have reached the clipping limit for this item>", "The Linux Command Line": "The /usr/local tree is where programs that are not included with your distribution but are intended for system-wide use are installed. The /etc directory contains all of the system-wide configuration files. It also contains a collection of shell scripts that start each of the system services at boot time. The /var directory tree is where data that is likely to change is stored. Various databases, spool files, user mail, etc. are located here.

A trusted central mediator such as PayPal can track payments and money transfers in a privately held account ledger, but it wasn\u2019t clear how a group of strangers who do not trust each other could accomplish the same transactions dependably.4 Sometimes referred to as the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem, this fundamental conundrum also emerges in computer science, specifically in how to achieve Until recently, people could not send digital cash back and forth to each other in a reliable way without a central mediator. A trusted central mediator such as PayPal can track payments and money transfers in a privately held account ledger, but it wasn\u2019t clear how a group of strangers who do not trust each other could accomplish the same transactions dependably.4 Sometimes referred to as the Byzantine Generals\u2019 Problem, this fundamental conundrum also emerges in computer science, specifically in how to achieve consensus on a distributed network. In January of 2009, the first bitcoins were distributed using the early Bitcoin software, and since then transactions have been running smoothly. The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that\u2019s required to make it work. The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that\u2019s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. \u2014Satoshi Nakamoto, first post on the P2Pfoundation forum about Bitcoin, February 11, 2009 I think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that\u2019s missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash. A method whereby, on the Internet, you can transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A. \u2014Milton Friedman, American economist and Nobel laureate, 1999 interview conducted by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation If Bitcoin were ever to become a popular store of value, it would represent some fraction of that $175 trillion. Even if only 1 percent of the world\u2019s wealth was stored in the form of bitcoins, the total value of the Bitcoin economy would be in the multitrillion-dollar range. Since we know that there will only ever be at most 21 million bitcoins in circulation, each bitcoin would need to be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in order for Bitcoin to store 1 percent of the world\u2019s wealth. Using these assumptions, we can roughly estimate that approximately $1,200 needs to be in circulation per person at any moment. For 1 billion people, a total of $1.2 trillion worth of currency needs to be in circulation as a medium of exchange for the world economy to function. If Bitcoin became a widely adopted medium of exchange, some part of this $1.2 trillion payment economy would be executed in bitcoins. Again, because of the hard limit of 21 million bitcoins, we know that if bitcoins were used for just 1 percent of the world\u2019s transactions, then each bitcoin would need to be worth tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The idea that it\u2019s acceptable and normal to use tools that protect privacy is called anonymity by default. Another ethically contentious facet of Bitcoin is that miners expend enormous amounts of energy when mining for bitcoins. These energy costs are significant, and some people have argued that this makes Bitcoin wasteful and harmful to the environment. However, this argument does not take into account the massive costs that are expended by our existing financial system for security. Every armored van, security officer, and bank vault that is used to protect traditional currency uses resources, and if we moved to a currency that leverages modern cryptography for security, many of these traditional security mechanisms that physically deter thieves from accessing this money may in theory no longer be necessary. radical decentralization, which maintains that all decentralization (including the functions of the government) is desirable and possible. This idea is a direct extension of the philosophies of Friedrich Hayek, who reasoned that local control is usually preferable to central control, because local people have more knowledge about local conditions and can therefore behave more efficiently in most situations. Another, more exciting, use of cryptographic hash functions is proving that you know a secret password without giving it away. Imagine you are a spy behind enemy lines. After many days of traveling under the cloak of darkness, you finally reach a guarded warehouse to meet with fellow agents. A guard at the front door asks you for the secret code, but you aren\u2019t sure whether the guard is on your side. You need to prove that you know the code without risking the mission by letting your secret code fall into the wrong hands! What do you do? You give him a hash of the secret code. If he knows the code, he can calculate the hash and verify that you also know it. If he doesn\u2019t and isn\u2019t supposed to know the code, you haven\u2019t revealed it. Each block in the blockchain contains a list of transactions and a hash of the transactions in the previous block in the chain. Hence, it\u2019s impossible to alter just one transaction in a block in the middle without causing a mismatch between the expected block hash and the hash recorded in the next block. This verification provides an efficient way for a single node to check whether transactions in its copy of the blockchain have been tampered with. Rather than checking every transaction in the entire transaction history, a node can simply check whether the hash of each block matches the recorded hash of subsequent blocks. The one-way function used in Bitcoin mining is a cryptographic hash function. Miners are given the output criteria (the output can be any number less than some threshold), but by design, cryptographic hash functions make it difficult to reverse calculate what the corresponding input needs to be. Therefore, Bitcoin miners can only randomly choose different inputs, hoping that the output will be a number below the threshold. Once a miner determines the correct input value, it is easy to prove his or her work to others by sharing that value with others who can easily recalculate the hash. Mining is also the process by which new Bitcoin transactions are added to the block-chain, or the public ledger. By adding a new block of transactions to the blockchain, the miner who added the block is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins (as well as old bitcoins in the form of transaction fees). Every Bitcoin user constantly receives blocks from other users on the network. These blocks may be part of different, competing branches in the main Bitcoin blockchain and therefore represent conflicting versions of the true ledger. Hence, the software running on every user\u2019s computer constantly evaluates blocks as they appear on the network and decides which one is the most trustworthy and likely to be part of the accepted blockchain in the future. How does it decide? It simply picks the one that has the most blocks (i.e., has the longest blockchain). This is considered the oldest and so came first. A blockchain with 12 blocks has existed for longer than one with 7 blocks. However, this method of deciding which chain to trust works only if a malicious peer cannot create a second ledger, immediately add 10 (or more) blocks to it, and make it seem as though the second ledger predated the first. For this reason, the Bitcoin software checks how much computational work was required to add each block in competing branches. The amount of work used to add a block is easy to verify (they call it a proof-of-work algorithm because you can prove that you did the work). The branch with the \u201cmost work\u201d is usually the longest one (i.e., the one with the most blocks), but if someone cheated by making a long branch with lots of \u201ceasy\u201d blocks, it wouldn\u2019t count. For a malicious peer to create a second ledger, erase his old transactions, and convince everyone his ledger was first, he would have to add blocks to it more quickly than the rest of the network. The only way to accomplish such fraud would be to privately control more computational power than the entire Bitcoin network. This type of abuse is called the 51 percent attack, and there is a good reason why it has never happened. The only way to carry out a 51 percent attack is to invest more heavily in Bitcoin mining than everyone else on the network combined, and the only advantage gained is being able to double-spend your own bitcoins. But the rewards of doing so are limited: Such an attack would undermine people\u2019s confidence in the Bitcoin system, and the attacker\u2019s bitcoins would become devalued. Nodes can be grouped into three categories: those that only broadcast transactions; those that broadcast and relay transactions; and those that broadcast, relay, and create new blocks with transactions.", "The Little Town Where Time Stood Still": "It is, perhaps, Hrabal\u2019s most powerful text: essentially a dirge for the \u201cold times\u201d before the advent of cruel European dictatorships \u2013 times that, whatever they were, possessed at least a human face.

So too with the Internet. Both were generative: they were designed to accept any contribution that followed a basic set of rules (either coded for a particular operating system, or respecting the protocols of the Internet). But the future unfolding right now is very different from this past. The future is not one of generative PCs attached to a generative network. It is instead one of sterile appliances tethered to a network of control. And the fact that a Web page can be and often is rendered on the fly by drawing upon hundreds of different sources scattered across the Net\u2014a page may pull in content from its owner, advertisements from a syndicate, and links from various other feeds\u2014means that bad code can infect huge swaths of the Web in a heartbeat. A lockdown on PCs and a corresponding rise of tethered appliances will eliminate what today we take for granted: a world where mainstream technology can be influenced, even revolutionized, out of left field. Stopping this future depends on some wisely developed and implemented locks, along with new technologies and a community ethos that secures the keys to those locks among groups with shared norms and a sense of public purpose, rather than in the hands of a single gatekeeping entity, whether public or private. The iPhone is a product of both fashion and fear. This first part of the book traces the battle between the centralized proprietary networks and the Internet, and a corresponding fight between specialized information appliances like smart typewriters and the general-purpose PC, highlighting the qualities that allowed the Internet and PC to win. the same qualities that led to their successes are causing the Internet and the PC to falter. As ubiquitous as Internet technologies are today, the pieces are in place for a wholesale shift away from the original chaotic design that has given rise to the modern information revolution. This counterrevolution would push mainstream users away from a generative Internet that fosters innovation and disruption, to an appliancized network that incorporates some of the most powerful features of today\u2019s Internet while greatly limiting its innovative capacity\u2014and, Too often, a discussion of the Internet and its future stops just short of its endpoints, focusing only on the literal network itself: how many people are connected, whether and how it is filtered, and how fast it carries data.2 These are important questions, but they risk obscuring the reality that people\u2019s experiences with the Internet are shaped at least as much by the devices they use to access it. Internet users are again embracing a range of \u201ctethered appliances,\u201d reflecting a resurgence of the initial model of bundled hardware and software that is created and controlled by one company. PC makers were selling potential functionality as much as they were selling actual uses, and many makers considered themselves to be in the hardware business only. To them, the PCs were solutions waiting for problems. Most significantly, PCs were designed to run software written by authors other than the PC manufacturer or those with whom the PC manufacturer had special arrangements The PC\u2019s ability to support a variety of programs from a variety of makers meant that it soon outpaced the functionality of appliancized machines like dedicated word processors, which were built to function the same way over the entire life of the machine. These machines may have been bought for one purpose, but the flexible architecture\u2014one that made them ready to be programmed using software from any number of sources\u2014 meant that they could quickly be redeployed for another. Someone could buy a PC for word processing and then discover the joys of e-mail, or gaming, or the Web. The more outside developers there were writing new code, the more valuable a computer would become to more people. the Microsoft antitrust cases of the 1990s arose from attempts to link operating system dominance to application dominance\u2014 the most successful business model for both Microsoft and Apple has been to make their computers\u2019 operating systems appealing for third-party software development, since they profit handsomely from the sale of the platforms themselves.21 the idea of user-maintained and user-tweaked computers running code from many different sources was substantially enhanced by first being proven in environments more amenable to experimentation and risk-taking. The story of the PC versus the information appliance is the first in a recurring pattern. The pattern begins with a generative platform that invites contributions from anyone who cares to make them. The contributions start among amateurs, who participate more for fun and whimsy than for profit. Their work, previously unnoticed in the mainstream, begins to catch on, and the power of the market kicks in to regularize their innovations and deploy them in markets far larger than the amateurs\u2019 domains. Finally, the generative features that invite contribution and that worked so well to propel the first stage of innovation begin to invite trouble and reconsideration, as the power of openness to third-party contribution destabilizes its first set of gains. the crucial element of the PC\u2019s success is not that it has a cheap processor inside, but that it is generative: it is open to reprogramming and thus repur-posing by anyone. That we use the Internet today is not solely a matter of some policy-maker\u2019s choice, although certain regulatory interventions and government funding were necessary to its success. It is due to an interplay of market forces and network externalities that are based on presumptions such as how trustworthy we can expect people to be. As those presumptions begin to change, so too will the shape of the network and the things we connect to it. different network configurations lead not only to different levels of generativity, but also to different levels of regulability and control.

However (and this apparently is the controversial part), I agree with Thomas Jefferson: the government has no duty to make sure authors get paid. The law about what is stealing is very clear. Stealing is taking something away from someone so they cannot use it. There\u2019s no way that making a copy of something is stealing under that definition. You can\u2019t just punish people because they took away a \u201cpotential sale.\u201d as a simple matter of technology, it\u2019s going to be increasingly difficult to get people to stop copying. We can almost always get around the technical measures and we can find technical ways around most of the social ones.

CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold A magnificent achievement. Charles Petzold starts with the story of two kids across the street who wish to communicate with each other and, from this simple beginning, builds up an entire computer without ever making it seem like something that should be over your head. I never really felt I understood the computer until I read this book. Despite his unusual interests and open mind, Levitt remains an economist and has the economist\u2019s typical right-wing assumptions: most notably, a strong commitment to incentives and an unquestioning faith in societal order. But it\u2019s still a fun and interesting book. However, I believe its most important point is one that\u2019s not stated explicitly: that through the proper investigation of the numbers we can better understand our world. For as long as I\u2019ve been building web apps, it\u2019s been apparent that most successful websites are communities\u2014not just interactive pages, but places where groups of like-minded people can congregate and do things together. In other words, instead of providing a place for a group of like-minded people to come together, magazines provide a sampling of what a group of like-minded people might say in such an instance so that you can pretend you\u2019re part of them. intellectual honesty requires bending over backwards to provide any evidence that you might be wrong, even if you\u2019re convinced that you are right. I propose instead that one ask \u201cWhat have you been thinking about lately?\u201d Second, it sends the message that thinking, and thinking about thinking, is a fundamental human activity, and thus encourages it. Grace Llewellyn\u2019s The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education Online, Aaron found a community that pointed to the possibility of another way of doing things. Far-flung Internet users helped him master the art of computer programming, offering feedback and assistance and encouraging his love of coding\u2014of knowledge\u2014instead of enforcing rote memorization and instilling fear of failure, as a more orthodox student-teacher relationship might. Aaron believes human beings are naturally curious; the problem is that conventional schooling stamps this inherent inquisitiveness out of us. Students are so afraid of getting answers wrong, so terrified of seeing a big F written in red pen, that they retreat into apathy, hedging their bets to finish the required assignments instead of taking the risks true engagement requires. Fear of humiliation, in other words, squelches experimentation. keen and conscientious mind at work, \u201cEven casual observations of infants reveals their delight in making events occur.\u201d\u2020\u2020 In short, little kids are curiosity machines. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that we human beings can do this; we need to do it,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cWe seem to have a kind of explanatory drive, like our drive for food or sex. When we\u2019re presented with a puzzle, a mystery, a hint of a pattern, something that doesn\u2019t quite make sense, we work until we find a solution. In fact, we intentionally set ourselves such problems, even the quite trivial ones that divert us from the horror of airplane travel, like crossword puzzles, video games, or detective stories. As scientists, we may stay up all night in the grip of a problem, even forgetting to eat, and it seems rather unlikely that our paltry salaries are the sole motivation.\u201d But what strikes me most when I revisit the classrooms I grew up in is how small they seem now. In my memory, the teachers are giants and the rooms were designed for other giants like them. The desks were big and dangerous contraptions, the blackboards seemed endless, the desks and tables imposing figures. But that was my world: day in and day out, those giants controlled my life, those children were my only companions. And what happened in these classes? I did not get to explore or experiment as I did at home. I did not learn things the way I had learned them the rest of my life\u2014through trial and error, through experience and experiment. No, school was the place for Real Learning and, I was told, Real Learning was Work. Most classes I was in, most classes I\u2019ve seen since\u2014even at the most progressive schools\u2014were much the same. The teacher sat at the front of the class and talked while the kids sat in front of them and listened. All those lectures were boring. I\u2019m sure I zoned out for most of them; I\u2019m sure most everybody else did as well. The teachers weren\u2019t oblivious to this, of course\u2014that\u2019s why they\u2019d call on us, punctuating the long hours of boredom with moments of panic and terror. Fear makes you dumb. Your field of vision literally narrows, you start thinking desperately about the problem at hand\u2014not what you know or what it means, but just whatever you need to say to escape the moment safely. This isn\u2019t about learning, this is about survival.", "The Art of Cruelty: A Reckoning": "This book asks different questions. It asks whether there are certain aspects or instances of the so-called art of cruelty\u2014as famously imagined by French dramatist and madman Antonin Artaud\u2014that are still wild and worthwhile, now that we purportedly inhabit a political and entertainment landscape increasingly glutted with images\u2014and actualities\u2014of torture, sadism, and endless warfare. It asks when and whether Artaud\u2019s distinction between a coarse sort of cruelty, based in sadism and bloodshed, and his notion of a \u201cpure cruelty, without bodily laceration\u201d can be productively made, and to what end. \u201cFrom the point of view of the mind,\u201d Artaud wrote, \u201ccruelty signifies rigor, implacable intention and decision, irreversible and absolute determination.\u201d the aim is to attend closely to the different excitements and effects of this \u201cpure cruelty\u201d (such as precision, transgression, purgation, productive unease, abjectness, radical exposure, uncanniness, unnerving frankness, acknowledged sadism and masochism, a sense of clearing or clarity), while also staying keenly attuned to the various sophistries and self-justifications that so often attend its valorization. I believe that the obsessive contemplation of our inhumanities can end up convincing us of the inevitability of our badness, and that we likely do ourselves a grave disservice by staying riveted by top-of-the-hour, ad nauseam \u201cproof \u201d that humans always have steadily pursued (and, the spurious logic goes, thus always will pursue) the bloody businesses of genocide, state-sponsored war, terrorism, and individual acts of sadism across space and time. Some of the most good-intentioned, activist, \u201ccompassionate\u201d art out there can end up being patronizing, ineffective, or exploitative And, of course, vice versa: much of the work that has no designs on eliciting compassion or bringing about emancipation can be the most salutary, the most liberating. art (or, for Aristotle, tragedy in particular) is a place where spectators can come to experience pain as both enjoyable and purgative. The \u201ccompulsion to repeat\u201d the trauma\u2014be it in art, nightmare, or waking life\u2014is the organism\u2019s attempt to master the surplus anxiety that the original incursion produced. \u201cthe point of art is to show people that life is worth living by showing that it isn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cMake no mistake: this is not about more intellectual sophistication,\u201d writes Roland Barthes in The Neutral. \u201cWhat I am looking for . . . is an introduction to living, a guide to life (ethical project): I want to live according to nuance. Now there is a teacher of nuance, literature; try to live according to the nuances that literature teaches me.\u201d From the start, Artaud was anxious to differentiate his concept of cruelty from that of simple sadism, violence, or bloodshed. His cruelty, he insisted, meant something quite different: \u201cthe appetite for life, a cosmic rigor and implacable necessity, in the gnostic sense of a living whirlwind that devours the darkness, in the sense of that pain apart from whose ineluctable necessity life could not continue.\u201d Like Nietzsche before him, Artaud insisted on cruelty because cruelty is associated not only with implacability, but also with evil. And both men considered the riotous reclamation of evil something of a necessary pit stop on the way to dancing with cosmic forces which have no truck with normative, especially religious, conceptions of morality. As Simone de Beauvoir summarized in her 1955 essay, \u201cMust We Burn Sade?\u201d if Rousseau held that \u201cNature is good; let us follow her,\u201d and Thomas Hobbes held that \u201cNature is evil; let us not follow her,\u201d Sade held that \u201cNature is evil; let us follow her.\u201d \u201cCruelty is simply the energy in a man civilization has not yet altogether corrupted,\u201d Sade wrote in 1795\u2019s Philosophy in the Bedroom. \u201cTherefore [cruelty] is a virtue, not a vice.\u201d But however ecstatic the communion, or however viscerally startling the transgression, this emphasis on bloodshed as a jumpstart into reality can be wearying. Indeed, whenever I read an articulate excoriation of the Viennese Actionists\u2014such as those written by artist Carolee Schneemann or feminist Germaine Greer\u2014the work can seem quickly ridiculous, a witless testament to a ludicrous white-boy repression, Austrian-style, literally trying to whip itself up to Wagnerian proportions. \u201cSoll niemand mein Schwanz steif machen?\u201d\u2014\u201cIs no one going to make my dick hard?\u201d\u2014a flaccid Otto Muehl reportedly yelled during a 1971 performance, a performance at which Muehl\u2019s sacrificial goose was seized (by the British poet Heathcote Williams, urged on by Greer) before it could meet its fate. Goose-less, Muehl ended up shitting on the stage instead. the anxiety over the relationship between art and life remains quite high; the mandate to break down the barriers between them, acute.  This anxiety and urgency\u2014often posed as a conflict between spectatorship and action, or between the simulated, or mediated, and the real\u2014is literally ancient. Plato famously thought mimesis (i.e., imitation, but also representation in a much broader sense) drew people away from truth, and therefore had a deleterious effect on the citizenry; it was for this reason that poets were to be banished from his ideal state of the republic. Aristotle had more of a social-control stance, arguing, via his theory of catharsis, that beholding evocative representations with the proper distance (such as going to see tragic theater) could provide a healthful outlet for impulses and ideas that might otherwise be disruptive to the social fabric. Aristotle defines tragedy as an imitation of an action \u201cwith incidents arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions.\u201d Artaud\u2014who, unlike Brecht, was no Marxist or seeker of social justice\u2014was more concerned with resurrecting the magic and rawness that he thought spectatorship stamped out of daily life. \u201cIf our life lacks brimstone, i.e., a constant magic, it is because we choose to observe our acts and lose ourselves in considerations of their imagined form instead of being impelled by their force,\u201d Artaud wrote. THE OTHER day, a friend hoping to gain some insight into my current project asked me to describe Artaud\u2019s theater of cruelty to him; I opened up to a weathered page of The Theater and Its Double and read aloud to him how it concentrates on \u201cfamous personages, atrocious crimes, and superhuman devotions,\u201d with a special appeal to the forces of \u201ccruelty and terror.\u201d \u201cSounds a lot like Hollywood,\u201d my friend shrugged, before returning to his book, unmoved. And so it does. In the end, the irony of Artaud\u2019s theater of cruelty may not lie in its legendary inapplicability, but rather in the fact that our age may have given the lie to its dream of the destructive, regenerative, revolutionary power of the spectacle. \u201cDon\u2019t think, say the stupid, says the vulgar herd, why try to think?\u201d wrote Artaud, who often experienced thinking as a sort of bodily agony. \u201cAs if without [thinking] it were possible to live.\u201d \u201cknowing the truth\u201d does not come with redemption as a guarantee, nor does a feeling of redemption guarantee an end to a cycle of wrongdoing. Placing all one\u2019s eggs in \u201cthe logic of exposure,\u201d as Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick has put it (in Touching Feeling), may also simply further the logic of paranoia. \u201cParanoia places its faith in exposure,\u201d Sedgwick observes\u2014which is to say that the exposure of a disturbing fact or situation does not necessarily alter it, but in fact may further the circular conviction that one can never be paranoid enough. in a cultural moment defined (by some, for some) by image flow, the question of what one should look at, along with attendant inquiries into the nature and effect of the images blowing by, has a creepy way of overtaking almost all other questions. BACK IN 1965, Sontag declared that we live in \u201can age of extremity,\u201d characterized by \u201cthe continual threat of two equally fearful, but seemingly opposed destinies: unremitting banality and inconceivable terror.\u201d Do we really live under the aegis of these opposing threats, or is it the very reiteration of them as our two primary ontological options (and our unthinking acquiescence to such a formulation) that acts as a truer threat to our enlivenment, to our full experience of the vast space between these two poles\u2014a space which, after all, is where the great majority of many of our lives takes place? given our inarguable complicity in all kinds of systemic forms of global injustice: is there any space left for not watching, not focusing, not keeping abreast of all the events and atrocities unfolding in the world, as an ethically viable option? \u201cWhy are we watching the news, reading the news, keeping up with the news?\u201d asks Annie Dillard in For the Time Being, a book that sets forth the deeply unfashionable argument that our times are not uniquely grievous\u2014that they are, in fact, not unique at all\u2014and further, that their vicissitudes may make no intrinsic demand on our attention, or on our conscience. As Italian political philosopher Paolo Virno has put it, \u201cNothing is less passive than the act of fleeing, of exiting.\u201d In anarchist circles, this withdrawal bears a relationship to the idea of the \u201cTAZ,\u201d or \u201ctemporary autonomous zones\u201d (as elaborated by writer Hakim Bey; Graeber prefers the term \u201cprovisional autonomous zones\u201d): ephemeral but crucial gaps in an otherwise suffocating global capitalist order, gaps that, at the very least, make other forms of social organization and perception seem momentarily possible. there\u2019s Sontag, whose final book, Regarding the Pain of Others, argues that to impugn the sense of sight for allowing us to \u201cstand back from the aggressiveness of the world\u201d and to free us up \u201cfor observation and for elective attention\u201d is to impugn the function of the mind itself. Sontag concludes, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with standing back and thinking. To paraphrase several sages: \u2018Nobody can think and hit someone at the same time.\u2019 The above-mentioned writers have dedicated their lives to slow seeing, slow thinking, measured articulation, and radical dissent or defection from any doxa that stifles existence or adds injustice to it. Rather than lambast that which mediates as our enemy, each makes a concerted effort to reclaim the value of the \u201cthird term.\u201d \u201cIn the logic of emancipation,\u201d Ranci\u00e8re writes, \u201cthere is always a third thing\u2014a book or some other piece of writing\u2014alien to both [teacher and student] and to which they can refer to verify in common what the pupil has seen, what she says about it and what she thinks about it.\u201d The emancipatory value of this third thing, as Ranci\u00e8re sees it, lies in the fact that no one can own it; no one can own its meaning. Its function is to mediate, but not in the sense of imitating or representing a reality from which spectators are barred. Here, \u201cthe mediate\u201d relates people to each other, with relation signifying the process of being brought together and given a measure of space from each other at the same time. This is essentially a spatial construct\u2014a diagram, or, as Bacon might have it, a ring of action\u2014that constructs both distance and association (or, if you like, individuality and collectivity). Its construction demarcates some sort of boundary, but it does not follow that the function of that boundary need be a constrictive or restrictive one. In fact, the function of the boundary may be wildly variable and even liberating, especially insofar as it creates sub-spaces, and guarantees that there can be a game. As philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein puts it, \u201cIf I surround an area with a fence or a line or otherwise, the purpose may be to prevent someone from getting in or out; but it may also be part of a game and the players supposed, say, to jump over the boundary; or it may shew where the property of one man ends and that of another begins; and so on. So if I draw a boundary line that is not yet to say what I am drawing it for.\u201d \u201cThe public realm, as the common world,\u201d Arendt wrote, \u201cgathers us together and yet prevents our falling over each other, so to speak. What makes mass society so difficult to bear is not the number of people involved, or at least not primarily, but the fact that the world between them has lost its power to gather them together, to relate and separate them. The weirdness of this situation resembles a spiritualistic s\u00e9ance where a number of people gathered round a table might suddenly, through some magic trick, see the table vanish from their midst, so that two persons sitting opposite each other were no longer separated but also would be entirely unrelated to each other by anything tangible.\u201d The mind-bending work of an artist such as Ryan Trecartin offers a particularly gripping example of the latter.  Trecartin\u2019s 2007 feature-length video, I-Be Area, while nominally based on the concept of \u201cvirtual reality,\u201d is a riotous exploration of what kinds of space, identity, physicality, language, sexuality, and consciousness might be possible once one leaves the dichotomy of the virtual and the real behind, along with a whole host of other need-not-apply binaries (the everyday and the apocalyptic, the public and the private, the utopic and the dystopic, male and female, gay and straight, among them). The hyperactive cloning, frenetic strobing of characters, and post-identity verbiage of I-Be Area make James Cameron\u2019s Avatar (2009) or the Internet game Second Life look like relics from the Stone Age. \u201cI love the idea of technology and culture moving faster than the understanding of those mediums by people,\u201d Trecartin has said, Richard Foreman articulates this aesthetic-of-amnesia quite well: \u201cThe image of the Marlboro man riding his horse and smoking his cigarette has stuck with me for many years\u2014and so what? It\u2019s garbage. It\u2019s kitsch. All it means is that the image seduced me, that it pushed a button that was ready to be pushed, and I responded. It didn\u2019t widen my sensibilities, compassion, or intuition. Whereas an art that affects you in the moment, but which you then find hard to remember, is straining to bring you to another level. It offers images or ideas from that other level, that other way of being, which is why you find them hard to remember. But it has opened you to the possibility of growing into what you are not yet, which is exactly what art should do.\u201d \u201cWe abide by cultural directives that urge us: clarify each thought, each experience, so you can cull from them their single, dominant meaning and, in the process, become a responsible adult who knows what he or she thinks,\u201d Foreman has said. \u201cBut what I try to show is the opposite: how at every moment, the world presents us with a composition in which a multitude of meanings and realities are available, and you are able to swim, lucid and self-contained, in that turbulent sea of multiplicity.\u201d IN Unbalancing Acts, Richard Foreman writes that reactionary critics are correct to worry that subversive forms of contemporary art might undermine Western culture. \u201cBut they shouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d he counsels calmly. \u201cSomething better is coming.\u201d Slavoj \u017di\u017eek explains (in The Ticklish Subject), lies \u201cthe unbearable paradox of this postmodern \u2018disalienation\u2019: the tension is no longer between my innermost creative impulses and the Institution that does not appreciate them or wants to crush them in order to \u2018normalize\u2019 me.\u201d Instead, according to \u017di\u017eek, postmodern corporations (such as Microsoft) work in a more Foucauldian fashion: rather than be threatened by our idiosyncratic creativity, they depend on putting it into service on their own behalf. As \u017di\u017eek puts it, one becomes useless for them the moment one starts losing one\u2019s \u201cimp of perversity.\u201d \u201cchallenges prevailing assumptions that the only possible relationship between women and violence requires women to be the victims.\u201d \u201cIn life,\u201d Evenson says, \u201cviolence happens to you. In literature, you make the choice to pick up the book and read, and to continue reading.\u201d He is right\u2014consent is absolutely key. The feeling that we have been violated by a work of art is compounded\u2014and perhaps made tolerable\u2014by the fact that we chose to experience it, come what may. Joseph Beuys gives us the sentiment with an activist twist: \u201cA lifetime is not so long,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou cannot wait for a tool without blood on it.\u201d", "The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom": "Information, knowledge, and culture are central to human freedom and human development. How they are produced and exchanged in our society critically affects the way we see the state of the world as it is and might be; who decides these questions; and how we, as societies and polities, come to understand what can and ought to be done. the emergence of a new information environment, one in which individuals are free to take a more active role than was possible in the industrial information economy of the twentieth century. The most advanced economies in the world today have made two parallel shifts that, paradoxically, make possible a significant attenuation of the limitations that market-based production places on the pursuit of the political The first move, in the making for more than a century, is to an economy centered on information (financial services, accounting, software, science) and cultural (films, music) production, and the manipulation of symbols (from making sneakers to branding them and manufacturing the cultural significance of the Swoosh). The second is the move to a communications environment built on cheap processors with high computation capabilities, interconnected in a pervasive network-the phenomenon we associate with the Internet. What characterizes the networked information economy is that decentralized individual action-specifically, new and important cooperative and coordinate action carried out through radically distributed, nonmarket mechanisms that do not depend on proprietary strategies-plays a much greater role than it did, or could have, in the industrial information economy. nonproprietary strategies have always been more important in information production than they were in the production of steel or automobiles, even when the economics of communication weighed in favor of industrial models. Education, arts and sciences, political debate, and theological disputation have always been much more importantly infused with nonmarket motivations and actors than, say, the automobile industry. we have in fact seen the rise of nonmarket production to much greater importance. the aggregate effect of individual action, even when it is not self-consciously cooperative, produces the rise of effective, large-scale cooperative efforts-peer production of information, knowledge, and culture. These are typified by the emergence of free and open-source software. We are beginning to see the expansion of this model not only to our core software platforms, but beyond them into every domain of information and cultural production-and this book visits these in many different domains-from peer production of encyclopedias, to news and commentary, to immersive entertainment. We We act for material gain, but also for psychological well-being and gratification, and for social connectedness. In the industrial economy in general, and the industrial information economy as well, most opportunities to make things that were valuable and important to many people were constrained by the physical capital requirements of making them. Financing the necessary physical capital, in turn, oriented the necessarily capital-intensive projects toward a production and organizational strategy that could justify the investments. In either case, the practical individual freedom to cooperate with others in making things of value was limited by the extent of the capital requirements of production. In the networked information economy, the physical capital required for production is broadly distributed throughout society. a good deal more that human beings value can now be done by individuals, who interact with each other socially, as human beings and as social beings, rather than as market actors through the price system. The result is a flourishing nonmarket sector of information, knowledge, and cultural production, based in the networked environment, and applied to anything that the many individuals connected to it can imagine. Its outputs, in turn, are not treated as exclusive property. They are instead subject to an increasingly robust ethic of open sharing, open for all others to build on, extend, and make their own. How we make information, how we get it, how we speak to others, and how others speak to us are core components of the shape of freedom in any society. The networked information economy improves the practical capacities of individuals along three dimensions: (r) it improves their capacity to do more for and by themselves; (z) it enhances their capacity to do more in loose commonality with others, without being constrained to organize their relationship through a price system or in traditional hierarchical models of social and economic organization; and (3) it improves the capacity of individuals to do more in formal organizations that operate outside the market sphere. The networked information economy provides varied alternative platforms for communication, so that it moderates the power of the traditional mass-media model, where ownership of the means of communication enables an owner to select what others view, and thereby to affect their perceptions of what they can and cannot do. This gives individuals a significantly greater role in authoring their own lives, by enabling them to perceive a broader range of possibilities, and by providing them a richer baseline against which to measure the choices they in fact make. the Babel objection, when everyone can speak, no one can be heard, and we devolve either to a cacophony or to the reemergence of money as the distinguishing factor between statements that are heard and those that wallow in obscurity. The second-generation critique was that the Internet is not as decentralized as we thought in the 199os. The emerging patterns of Internet use show that very few sites capture an exceedingly large amount of attention, and millions of sites go unnoticed. In this world, the Babel objection is perhaps avoided, but only at the expense of the very promise of the Internet as a democratic medium. I suggest that the networked public sphere enables many more individuals to communicate their observations and their viewpoints to many others, and to do so in a way that cannot be controlled by media owners and is not as easily corruptible by money as were the mass media. we are beginning to see the emergence of nonmarket, peer-produced alternative sources of filtration and accreditation in place of the market-based alternatives. Relevance and accreditation are themselves information goods, just like software or an encyclopedia. we are beginning to see the emergence of nonmarket, peer-produced alternative sources of filtration and accreditation in place of the market-based alternatives. Relevance and accreditation are themselves information goods, just like software or an encyclopedia. What we are seeing on the network is that filtering for both relevance and accreditation has become the object of widespread practices of mutual pointing, of peer review, of pointing to original sources of claims, and its complement, the social practice that those who have some ability to evaluate the claims in fact do comment on them. information flow in the network is much more ordered than a simple random walk in the cacophony of information flow would suggest, and significantly less centralized than the mass media environment was. Some sites are much more visible and widely read than others. This is true both when one looks at the Web as a whole, and when one looks at smaller clusters of similar sites or users who tend to cluster. Sites cluster around communities of interest: In each of these clusters, the pattern of some high visibility nodes continues, but as the clusters become small enough, many more of the sites are moderately linked to each other in the cluster. Through this pattern, the network seems to be forming into an attention backbone. \"Local\" clusters-communities of interest-can provide initial vetting and \"peer-review-like\" qualities to individual contributions made within an interest cluster. Observations that are seen as significant within a community Users tend to treat other people's choices about what to link to and to read as good indicators of what is worthwhile for them. They are not slavish in this, though; they apply some judgment of their own as to whether certain types of users-say, political junkies of a particular stripe, or fans of a specific television program-are the best predictors of what will be interesting for them. The result is that attention in the networked environment is more dependent on being interesting to an engaged group of people than it is in the mass-media environment, where moderate interest to large numbers of weakly engaged viewers is preferable. Neither deterministic nor wholly malleable, technology sets some parameters of individual and social action. What I find new and interesting about the networked information economy is the rise of individual practical capabilities, and the role that these new capabilities play in increasing the relative salience of nonproprietary, often nonmarket individual and social behavior. I suggest that the state could play constructive roles, if it stopped listening to incumbents for long enough to realize this. These include, for example, municipal funding of neutral broadband networks, state funding of basic research, and possible strategic regulatory interventions to negate monopoly control over essential resources in the digital environment. If the transformation I describe as possible occurs, it will lead to substantial redistribution of power and money from the twentieth-century industrial producers of information, culture, and communications-like Hollywood, the recording industry, and perhaps the broadcasters and some of the telecommunications services giants-to a combination of widely diffuse populations around the globe, and the market actors that will build the tools that make this population better able to produce its own information environment rather than buying it ready-made. The reorganization of production and the advances it can bring in freedom and justice will emerge, therefore, only as a result of social and political action aimed at protecting the new social patterns from the incumbents' assaults. To what extent will resources necessary for information production and exchange be governed as a commons, free for all to use and biased in their availability in favor of none? Its central question is whether there will, or will not, be a core common infrastructure that is governed as a commons and therefore available to anyone who wishes to participate in the networked information environment outside of the market-based, proprietary framework. Property, together with contract, is the core institutional component of markets, and The freedom of action for individuals who wish to produce information, knowledge, and culture is being systematically curtailed in order to secure the economic returns demanded by the manufacturers of the industrial information economy. A rich literature in law has developed in response to this increasing enclosure over the past twenty years. It started with David Lange's evocative exploration of the public domain and Pamela Samuelson's prescient critique of the application of copyright to computer programs and digital materials, and continued through Jessica Litman's work on the public domain and digital copyright and Boyle's exploration of the basic romantic assumptions underlying our emerging \"intellectual property\" construct and the need for an environmentalist framework for preserving the public domain. The lack of either analytic or empirical foundation for the regulatory drive toward ever-stronger proprietary rights has not, however, resulted in a transformed politics of the regulation of intellectual production. The actual practices of human interaction with information, knowledge, and culture and with production and consumption are the consequence of a feedback effect between social practices, economic organization, technological affordances, and formal constraints on behavior through law and similar institutional forms. These components of the constraints and affordances of human behavior tend to adapt dynamically to each other, so that the tension between the technological affordances, the social and economic practices, and the law are often not too great. During periods of stability, these components of the structure within which human beings live are mostly aligned and mutually reinforce We are in the midst of a technological, economic, and organizational transformation that allows us to renegotiate the terms of freedom, justice, and productivity in the information society. How we shall live in this new environment will in some significant measure depend on policy choices that we make over the next decade or so. To be able to understand these choices, to be able to make them well, we must recognize that they are part of what is fundamentally a social and political choice-a choice about how to be free, equal, productive human beings under a new set of technological and For more than 150 years, new communications technologies have tended to concentrate and commercialize the production and exchange of information, while extending the geographic and social reach of information distribution networks. As the size of the audience and its geographic and social dispersion increased, public discourse developed an increasingly one-way model. Information and opinion that was widely known and formed the shared basis for political conversation and broad social relations flowed from ever more capital-intensive commercial and professional producers to passive, undifferentiated consumers. The economics of long-distance mass distribution systems necessary to reach this constantly increasing and more dispersed relevant population were typified by high up-front costs and low marginal costs of distribution. These cost characteristics drove cultural production toward delivery to ever-wider audiences of increasingly high production-value goods, whose fixed costs could be spread over ever-larger audiences-like television series, recorded music, and movies. The Internet presents the possibility of a radical reversal of this long trend. It is the first modern communications medium that expands its reach by decentralizing the capital structure of production and distribution of information, culture, and knowledge. The way life is actually lived by people within a given set of interlocking technological, economic, institutional, and social practices is what makes a society attractive or unattractive, what renders its practices laudable or lamentable. \"information economy\" in various permutations since the 1970s. The term has been used widely to signify the dramatic increase in the importance of usable information as a means of controlling production and the flow of inputs, outputs, and services. Radical decentralization of intelligence in our communications network and the centrality of information, knowledge, culture, and ideas to advanced economic activity are leading to a new stage of the information economy-the networked information economy. The most important aspect of the networked information economy is the possibility it opens for reversing the control focus of the industrial information economy. In particular, it holds out the possibility of reversing two trends in cultural production central to the project of control: concentration and commercialization. Two fundamental facts have changed in the economic ecology in which the industrial information enterprises have arisen. First, the basic output that has become dominant in the most advanced economies is human meaning and communication. Second, the basic physical capital necessary to express and communicate human meaning is the connected personal computer. Together, these changes destabilize the industrial stage of the information economy. The high capital costs that were a prerequisite to gathering, working, and communicating information, knowledge, and culture, have now been widely distributed in the society. The technical conditions of communication and information processing are enabling the emergence of new social and economic practices of information and knowledge production. it is the technological shock, combined with the economic sustainability of the emerging social practices, that creates the new set of social and political opportunities that are the subject of this book. It flows from fairly standard economic analysis applied to a very nonstandard economic reality: one in which all the means of producing and exchanging information and culture are placed in the hands of hundreds of millions, and eventually billions, of people around the world, available for them to work with not only when they are functioning in the market to keep body and soul together, but also, and with equal efficacy, when they are functioning in society and alone, trying to give meaning to their lives as individuals and as social beings. Why do we rely almost exclusively on markets and commercial firms to produce cars, steel, and wheat, but much less so for the most critical information our advanced societies depend on? Is this a historical contingency, or is there something about information as an object of production that makes nonmarket production attractive? certain characteristics of information and culture lead us to understand them as \"public the information itself need only be created once. Economists call such goods \"public\" because a market will not produce them if priced at their marginal cost-zero. In order to provide Tolstoy or the scientist with income, we regulate publishing: We pass laws that enable their publishers to prevent competitors from entering the market. Because no competitors are permitted into the market for copies of War and Peace, the publishers can price the contents of the book or journal at above their actual marginal cost of zero. Even if these laws are therefore necessary to create the incentives for publication, the market that develops based on them will, from the technical economic perspective, systematically be inefficient. \"precisely to the extent that [property] is effective, there is underutilization of the information.\"' Because welfare economics defines a market as producing a good efficiently only when it is pricing the good at its marginal cost, a good like information (and culture and knowledge are, for purposes of economics, forms of information), which can never be sold both at a positive (greater than zero) price and at its marginal cost, is fundamentally a candidate for substantial nonmarket production. From the perspective of a society's overall welfare, the most efficient thing would be for those who possess information to give it away for free-or rather, for the cost of communicating it and no more. we are willing to have some inefficient lack of access to information every day, in exchange for getting more people involved in information production over time. Authors and inventors or, more commonly, companies that contract with musicians and filmmakers, scientists, and engineers, will invest in research and create cultural goods because they expect to sell their information products. Over time, this incentive effect will give us more innovation and creativity, which will outweigh the inefficiency at any given moment caused by selling the information at above its marginal cost. This defense of exclusive rights is limited by the extent to which it correctly describes the motivations of information producers and the business models open to them to appropriate the benefits of their investments. Authors and inventors or, more commonly, companies that contract with musicians and filmmakers, scientists, and engineers, will invest in research and create cultural goods because they expect to sell their information products. Over time, this incentive effect will give us more innovation and creativity, which will outweigh the inefficiency at any given moment caused by selling the information at above its marginal cost. This defense of exclusive rights is limited by the extent to which it correctly describes the motivations of information producers and the business models open to them to appropriate the benefits of their investments. If some information producers do not need to capture the economic benefits of their particular information outputs, or if some businesses can capture the economic value of their information production by means other than exclusive control over their products, then the justification for regulating access by granting copyrights or patents is weakened. As I will discuss in detail, both of these limits on the standard defense are in fact the case. The other crucial quirkiness is that information is both input and output of its own production process. This second quirkiness The reason is that if any new information good or innovation builds on existing information, then strengthening intellectual property rights increases the prices that those who invest in producing information today must pay to those who did so yesterday, in addition to increasing the rewards an information producer can get tomorrow. If we pass a law that regulates information production too strictly, allowing its beneficiaries to impose prices that are too high on today's innovators, then we will have not only too little consumption of information today, but also too little production of new information for tomorrow. the most amazing document of the consensus among economists today that, because of the combination of nonrivalry and the \"on the shoulders of giants\" effect, excessive expansion of \"intellectual property\" protection is economically detrimental, was the economists' brief filed in the Supreme Court case of Eldred v. Ashcroft.3 The efficiency of regulating information, knowledge, and cultural production through strong copyright and patent is not only theoretically ambiguous, it also lacks empirical basis. when a country-either one that already has a significant patent system, or a developing nation-increases its patent protection, it slightly decreases the level of investment in innovation by local firms. the reality of both theory and empirics in the economics of intellectual property is that both in theory and as far as empirical evidence shows, there is remarkably little support in economics for regulating information, knowledge, and cultural production through the tools of intellectual property law. Where does innovation and information production come from, then, if it does not come as much from intellectual-property-based market actors, as many generally believe? The answer is that it comes mostly from a mixture of (i) nonmarket sources-both state and nonstate-and (2) market actors whose business models do not depend on the regulatory framework of intellectual property. the widely held intuition that markets are more or less the best way to produce goods, that property rights and contracts are efficient ways of organizing production decisions, and that subsidies distort production decisions, is only very ambiguously applicable to information. The actual universe of information production in the economy then, is not as dependent on property rights and markets in information goods as the last quarter century's increasing obsession with \"intellectual property\" might industry surveys concerned with patents have shown that the vast majority of industrial R&D is pursued with strategies that do not rely primarily on patents. \"Scholarly Lawyers,\" relies on demand-side effects of access to the information the producer distributes. It relies on the fact that sometimes using an information good that one has produced makes its users seek out a relationship with the author. The author then charges for the relationship, not for the information. Doctors or lawyers who publish in trade journals, become known, and get business as a result are an instance of this strategy. An enormously creative industry, much of which operates on this model, is software. comparatively limited role that production based purely on exclusive rights-like patents, copyrights, and similar regulatory constraints on the use and exchange of information-has played in our information production system to this day. exclusive rights always cause static inefficiency-that is, they allow producers to charge positive prices for products (information) that have a zero marginal cost. Whether, overall, any given regulatory change that increases the scope of exclusive rights improves or undermines new innovation therefore depends on whether, given the level of appropriability that preceded it, it increased input costs more or less than it increased the prospect of being paid for one's outputs. Strong exclusive rights increase the attractiveness of exclusive-rights-based strategies at the expense of nonproprietary strategies, whether market-based or nonmarket based. Information and cultural production have three primary categories of inputs. The first is existing information and culture. We already know that existing information is a nonrival good-that is, its real marginal cost at any given moment is zero. The second major cost is that of the mechanical means of sensing our environment, processing it, and communicating new information goods. This is the high cost that typified the industrial model, and which has drastically declined in computer networks. The third factor is human communicative capacity-the creativity, experience, and cultural awareness necessary to take from the universe of existing information and cultural resources and turn them into new insights, symbols, or representations meaningful to others with whom we converse. Given the zero cost of existing information and the declining cost of communication and processing, human capacity becomes the primary scarce resource in the networked information economy. Human communicative capacity, however, is an input with radically different characteristics than those of, say, printing presses or satellites. It is held by each individual, and cannot be \"transferred\" from one person to another or aggregated like so many machines. It is something each of us innately has, though in divergent quanta and qualities. Individual human capacities, rather than the capacity to aggregate financial capital, become the economic core of our information and cultural production. its liberation from the constraints of physical capital leaves creative human beings much freer to engage in a wide range of information and cultural production practices than those they could afford to participate in when, in addition to creativity, experience, cultural awareness The difference that the digitally networked environment makes is its capacity to increase the efficacy, and therefore the importance, of many more, and more diverse, nonmarket producers It makes nonmarket strategies-from individual hobbyists to formal, well-funded nonprofits-vastly more effective than they could be in the mass-media environment. As Eben Moglen put it, \"if you wrap the Internet around every person on the planet and spin the planet, software flows in the network. It's an emergent property of connected human minds that they create things for one another's pleasure and to conquer their uneasy sense of being too alone.\"\" It is this combination of a will to create and to communicate with others, and a shared cultural experience that makes it likely that each of us wants to talk about something that we believe others will also want to talk about, that makes the billion potential participants in today's online conversation, and the six billion in tomorrow's conversation, affirmatively better than the commercial industrial model. Nonmarket behavior is becoming central to producing our information and cultural environment. It does not mean that there is no continued role economics of production in a digital environment should lead us to expect an increase in the relative salience of nonmarket production models in the overall mix of our information production system, and it is efficient for this to happen-more information will be produced, and much of it will be available for its users at its marginal cost. Sources of knowledge and cultural edification, through which we come to know and comprehend the world, to form our opinions about it, and to express ourselves in communication with others about what we see and believe have shifted from heavy reliance on commercial, concentrated media, to being produced on a much more widely distributed model, by many actors who are not driven by the imperatives of advertising or the sale of entertainment goods. copyright law coevolved with the industrial model. The institutional ecology, the political framework (the lobbyists, the habits of legislatures), and the legal culture (the beliefs of judges, the practices of lawyers) have not changed. They are as they developed over the course of the twentieth century-centered on optimizing the conditions of those commercial firms that thrive in the presence of strong exclusive rights in information and culture. We must understand these new modes of production. We must learn to evaluate them and compare their advantages and disadvantages to those of the industrial information producers. And then we must adjust our institutional environment to make way for the new social practices made possible by the networked environment. Free software offers a glimpse at a more basic and radical challenge. It suggests that the networked environment makes possible a new modality of organizing production: radically decentralized, collaborative, and nonproprietary; based on sharing resources and outputs among widely distributed, loosely connected individuals who cooperate with each other without relying on either market signals or managerial commands. This is what I call \"commons-based peer production.\" With property, law determines one particular person who has the authority to decide how the resource will be used. the core characteristic of property The salient characteristic of commons, as opposed to property, is that no single person has exclusive control over the use and disposition of any particular resource in the commons. Instead, resources governed by commons may be used or disposed of by anyone among some (more or less well-defined) number of persons, under rules that may range from \"anything goes\" to quite crisply articulated formal rules that are effectively enforced. Commons can be divided into four types based on two parameters. The first parameter is whether they are open to anyone or only to a defined group. The second parameter is whether a commons system is regulated or unregulated. the characteristic of commons is that the constraints, if any, are symmetric the inputs and outputs of the process are shared, freely or conditionally, in an institutional form that leaves them equally available for all to use as they choose at their individual discretion. commons leave individuals free to make their own choices with regard to resources managed as a commons-is It is the freedom to interact with resources and projects without seeking anyone's permission that marks commons-based production generally, and it is also that freedom that underlies the particular efficiencies of peer production, \"peer production\" characterizes a subset of commons-based production practices. It refers to production systems that depend on individual action that is self-selected and decentralized, rather than hierarchically assigned. \"Centralization\" is a particular response to the problem of how to make the behavior of many individual agents cohere into an effective pattern or achieve an effective result. Its primary attribute is the separation of the locus of opportunities for action from the authority to choose the action that the agent will undertake. \"Decentralization\" describes conditions under which the actions of many agents cohere and are effective despite the fact that they do not rely on reducing the number of people whose will counts to direct effective action. The most pervasive mode of \"decentralization,\" however, is the ideal market. Each individual agent acts according to his or her will. What we are seeing now is the emergence of more effective collective action practices that are decentralized but do not rely on either the price system or a managerial structure for coordination. The quintessential instance of commons-based peer production has been free software. In order to avoid having the joint product appropriated by any single party, participants usually retain copyrights in their contribution, but license them to anyone-participant or stranger-on a model that combines a universal license to use the materials with licensing constraints that make it difficult, if not impossible, for any single contributor or third party to appropriate the project. This model of licensing is the most important institutional innovation of the free software movement. Google, Amazon, and CNN.com, for example, run their Web servers on the GNU/Linux operating system. They do this, presumably, because they believe this peer-produced operating system is more reliable than the alternatives, not because the system is \"free.\" It would be absurd to risk a higher rate of failure in their core business activities in order to save a few hundred thousand dollars on licensing fees. he retained the copyright to the software he distributed, he could write this condition into the license that he attached to the software. This meant that anyone using or distributing the software as is, without modifying it, would not violate Stallman's license. They could also modify the software for their own use, and this would not violate the license. However, if they chose to distribute the modified software, they would violate Stallman's copyright unless they included a license identical to his with the software they distributed. This license became the GNU General Public License, or GPL. used-asserting his own copyright claims, but only to force all downstream users who wanted to rely on his contributions to make their own contributions available to everyone else-came to be known as \"copyleft,\" an ironic twist on copyright. Free software is about freedom (\"free as in free speech, not free beer\" is Stallman's epitaph for it). \"Open-source software\" was chosen as a term that would not carry the political connotations. It was simply a mode of organizing software production that may be more effective than market-based production. The best source for a phenomenology of open-source development continues to be Eric Raymond's Cathedral and Bazaar, written in 1998. This enables some of its users to identify problems and others to fix these problems without asking anyone's permission and without engaging in any transactions. The most surprising thing that the open source movement has shown, in real life, is that this simple model can operate on very different scales, from the small, three-person model I described for simple projects, up to the many thousands of people involved in writing the Linux kernel and the GNU/ Linux operating system-an immensely difficult production task. Free software is, without a doubt, the most visible instance of peer production at the turn of the twenty-first century. In particular, in some of the larger projects, most prominently the Linux kernel development process, a certain kind of meritocratic hierarchy is clearly present. Ubiquitous computer communications networks are bringing about a dramatic change in the scope, scale, and efficacy of peer production throughout the information and cultural production system. As computers become cheaper and as network connections become faster, cheaper, and ubiquitous, we are seeing the phenomenon of peer production of information scale to much larger sizes, performing more complex tasks than were possible in the past for nonprofessional production. The clickworkers project was a particularly clear example of how a complex professional task that requires a number of highly trained individuals on full-time salaries can be reorganized so as to be performed by tens of thousands of volunteers in increments so minute that the tasks could be performed on a much lower budget. Encyclopedic and almanac-type information emerges on the Web out of the coordinate but entirely independent action of millions of users. Wikipedia combines three core characteristics: First, it uses a collaborative authorship tool, Wiki. This platform enables anyone, including anonymous passersby, to edit almost any page in the entire project. It stores all versions, makes changes easily visible, and enables anyone to revert a document to any prior version as well as to add changes, small and large. Second, it is a self-conscious effort at creating an encyclopedia-governed first and foremost by a collective informal undertaking to strive for a neutral point of view, within the limits of substantial self-awareness as to the difficulties of such an enterprise. An effort the most interesting characteristic about Wikipedia is the self-conscious social-norms-based dedication to objective writing. It is generally open for anyone to edit the materials, delete another's change, debate the desirable contents, survey archives for prior changes, and so forth. It depends on self-conscious use of open discourse, usually aimed at consensus. The project relies instead on social norms to secure the dedication of project participants to objective writing. So, while not entirely anarchic, the project is nonetheless substantially more social, human, and intensively discourse- and trust-based than the other major projects described here. The aim is not to write articles from a single objective point of view-this is a common misunderstanding of the policy-but rather, to fairly and sympathetically present all views on an issue. The important point is that Wikipedia requires not only mechanical cooperation among people, but a commitment to a particular style of writing and describing concepts that is far from intuitive or natural to people. It requires self-discipline. It enforces the behavior it requires primarily through appeal to the common enterprise that the participants are engaged in, coupled with a thoroughly transparent platform that faithfully records and renders all individual interventions in the common project and facilitates discourse among participants about how their contributions do, or do not, contribute to this common enterprise. This combination of an explicit statement of common purpose, transparency, and the ability of participants to identify each other's actions and counteract them-that is, edit out \"bad\" or \"faithless\" definitions-seems to have succeeded in keeping this community from devolving into inefficacy or worse. What is perhaps surprising is that this success occurs not in a tightly knit community with many social relations to reinforce the sense of common purpose and the social norms embodying it, but in a large and geographically dispersed group of otherwise unrelated participants. It suggests that even in a group of this size, social norms coupled with a facility to allow any participant to edit out purposeful or mistaken deviations in contravention of the social norms, and a robust platform for largely unmediated conversation, keep the group on track. Users submit comments that are displayed together with the initial submission of a story. Think of the \"content\" produced in these comments as a cross between academic peer review of journal submissions and a peer-produced substitute for television's \"talking heads.\" the same dynamic that we saw used for peer production of initial utterances, or content, can be implemented to produce relevance and accreditation. Rather than using the full-time effort of professional accreditation experts, the system Distributed Proofreading, a site originally unaffiliated with Project Gutenberg, is devoted to proofing Project Gutenberg e-texts more efficiently, by distributing the volunteer proofreading function in smaller and more information-rich modules. find that users also cooperate in similar loosely affiliated groups, without market signals or managerial commands, to build supercomputers and massive data storage and retrieval systems. They differ in one important aspect: Users are not sharing their innate and acquired human capabilities, and, unlike information, their inputs and outputs are not public goods. The participants are, instead, sharing material goods that they privately own, mostly personal computers and their components. They produce economic, not public, goods-computation, storage, and communications capacity. the SETI@home project has developed software and a collaboration platform that have enabled millions of participants to pool their computation resources into a single powerful computer. Every user who participates in the project must download a small screen saver. When a user's personal computer is idle, the screen saver starts up, downloads problems for calculation-in SETI@home, these are radio astronomy signals to be analyzed for regularities-and calculates the problem it has downloaded. Other sites, like those dedicated to cryptography or mathematics, have a narrower appeal, and combine \"altruistic\" with hobby as their basic motivational appeal. The absence of money is, in any event, typical of the large majority of active distributed computing projects. Less than one-fifth of these projects mention money at all. Most of those that do mention money refer to the contributors' eligibility for a share of a generally available Most of the distributed computing projects provide a series of utilities and statistics intended to allow contributors to attach meaning to their contributions in a variety of ways. In these components, the project organizers seem to assume some degree of taste for generalized altruism and the pursuit of meaning in contributing to a common goal. They also implement a variety of mechanisms to reinforce the sense of purpose, such as providing aggregate statistics about the total computations performed by the project as a whole. However, the sites also seem to assume a healthy dose of what is known in the anthropology of gift literature as agonistic giving-that is, giving intended to show that the person giving is greater than or more important than others, who gave less. An interesting characteristic of quite a few of these is the ability to create \"teams\" of users, who in turn compete on who has provided more cycles or work units. In addition, the sites offer platforms for simple connectedness and mutual companionship, by offering user fora to discuss the science and the social participation involved. It also possible, however, that they have tapped into a valuable insight, which is that people behave sociably and generously for all sorts of different reasons, and that at least in this domain, adding reasons to participate-some agonistic, some altruistic, some reciprocity-seeking-does not have a crowding-out effect. What is truly unique about peer-to-peer networks as a signal of what is to come is the fact that with ridiculously low financial investment, a few teenagers and twenty-something-year-olds were able to write software and protocols that allowed tens of millions of computer users around the world to cooperate in producing the most efficient and robust file storage and retrieval system in the world. Architecture oriented toward enabling users to cooperate with each other in storage, search, retrieval, and delivery of files was all that was necessary to build a content distribution network that dwarfed anything that existed before. The broader point to take from looking at peer-to-peer file-sharing networks, however, is the sheer effectiveness of large-scale collaboration among individuals once they possess, under their individual control, the physical capital necessary to make their cooperation effective. These systems are not \"subsidized,\" in the sense that they do not pay the full marginal cost of their service. music, like all information, is a nonrival public good whose marginal cost, once produced, is zero. Moreover, digital files are not \"taken\" from one place in order to be played in the other. They are replicated wherever they are wanted, and thereby made more ubiquitous, not scarce. The only actual social cost involved at the time of the transmission is the storage capacity, communications capacity, and processing capacity necessary to store, catalog, search, retrieve, and transfer the information necessary to replicate the files from where copies reside to where more copies are desired. As with any nonrival good, if Jane is willing In addition to computation and storage, the last major element of computer communications networks is connectivity. nonmarket production in general and peer production in particular are phenomena of much wider application than free software, and exist in important ways throughout the networked information economy. why do people participate? What is their motivation when they work for or contribute resources to a project for which they are not paid or directly rewarded? What, if anything, is special about the digitally networked environment that would lead us to believe that peer production is here to stay as an important economic phenomenon, as opposed to a fad that will pass as the medium matures and patterns of behavior settle toward those more familiar to us from the economy of steel, coal, and temp agencies. is it efficient to have all these people sharing their computers and donating their time and creative effort? We merely need to see that the material conditions of production in the networked information economy have changed in ways that increase the relative salience of social sharing and exchange as a modality of economic production. That is, behaviors and motivation patterns familiar to us from social relations generally continue to cohere in their own patterns. What has changed is that now these patterns of behavior have become effective beyond the domains of building social relations of mutual interest and fulfilling our emotional and psychological needs of companionship and mutual recognition. They have come to play a substantial role as modes of motivating, informing, and organizing productive behavior at the very core of the information economy. It is the feasibility of producing information, knowledge, and culture through social, rather than market and proprietary relations-through cooperative peer production and coordinate individual action-that creates the opportunities for greater autonomous action, a more critical culture, a more discursively engaged and better informed republic, and perhaps a more equitable global community. Much of economics achieves analytic tractability by adopting a very simple model of human motivation. The basic assumption is that all human motivations can be more or less reduced to something like positive and negative utilities-things people want, and things people want to avoid. While simplistic, this highly tractable model of human motivation has enabled policy prescriptions that have proven far more productive than prescriptions that depended on other models of human motivation-such as assuming that benign administrators will be motivated to serve their people, or that individuals will undertake self-sacrifice for the good of the nation or the commune. this simple model underlying much of contemporary economics is wrong. At least it is wrong as a universal description of human motivation. The most systematic work within economics is that of Swiss economist Bruno Frey Across many different settings, researchers have found substantial evidence that, under some circumstances, adding money for an activity previously undertaken without price compensation reduces, rather than increases, the level of activity. \"there are two ultimate (or primitive) rewards for human beings in a social structure: economic standing and social standing. \"7 These rewards are understood as instrumental and, in this regard, are highly amenable to economics. Both economic and social aspects represent \"standing\"-that is, a relational measure expressed in terms of one's capacity to mobilize resources. Some resources can be mobilized by money. Social relations can mobilize others. For a wide range of reasons-institutional, cultural, and possibly technological-some resources are more readily capable of being mobilized by social relations than by money. The relative relationships of money and social-psychological rewards are, then, dependent on culture and context. Similar actions may have different meanings in different social or cultural contexts. However, well-adjusted, healthy individuals are rarely monolithic in their requirements. For all of us, there comes a time on any given day, week, and month, every year and in different degrees over our lifetimes, when we choose to act in some way that is oriented toward fulfilling our social and psychological needs, not our market-exchangeable needs. It is that part of our lives and our motivational structure that social production taps, and on which it thrives. What needs to be understood now, however, is under what conditions these many and diverse social actions can turn into an important modality of economic production. When can all these acts, distinct from our desire for The core technologically contingent fact that enables social relations to become a salient modality of production in the networked information economy is that all the inputs necessary to effective productive activity are under the control of individual users. This does not mean that all the physical capital necessary to process, store, and communicate information is under individual user control. That is not necessary. It is, rather, that the majority of individuals in these societies have the threshold level of material capacity required to explore the information environment they occupy, to take from it, and to make their own contributions to it. Natural or contingent, it is nevertheless a fact of the industrial base of the networked information economy that individual users-susceptible as they are to acting on diverse motivations, in diverse relationships, some market-based, some social-possess and control the physical capital necessary to make effective the human capacities they uniquely and individually possess. While creative capacity and judgment are universally distributed in a population, available time and attention are not, and human creative capacity cannot be fully dedicated to nonmarket, nonproprietary production all the time. Someone needs to work for money, at least some of the time, to pay the rent and put food on the table. Personal computers too are only used for earnings-generating activities some of the time. In both these resources, there remain large quantities of excess capacity-time and interest in human beings; processing, storage, and communications capacity in computers-available to be used for activities whose rewards are not monetary or monetizable, directly or indirectly. For this excess capacity to be harnessed and become effective, the information production process must effectively integrate widely dispersed contributions, from many individual human beings and machines. The great success of the Internet generally, and peer-production processes in particular, has been the adoption of technical and organizational architectures that have allowed them to pool such diverse efforts effectively. \"Modularity\" is a property of a project that describes the extent to which it can be broken down into smaller components, or modules, that can be independently produced before they are assembled into a whole. \"Granularity\" refers to the size of the modules, in terms of the time and effort that an individual must invest in producing them. The number of people who can, in principle, participate in a project is therefore inversely related to the size of the smallest-scale contribution necessary to produce a usable module. The granularity of the modules therefore sets the smallest possible individual investment necessary to participate in a project. If this investment is sufficiently low, then \"incentives\" for producing that component of a modular project can be of trivial magnitude. Because each contribution like Kick's can be independently created and stored, because no single permission point or failure point is present in the architecture of the Web-it is merely a way of conveniently labeling documents stored independently by many people who are connected to the Internet and use HTML (hypertext markup language) and HTTP (hypertext transfer proto- col)-as an \"information service,\" it is highly modular and diversely granular. Each independent contribution comprises as large or small an investment as its owner-operator chooses to make. The independence of Web sites is what marks their major difference from more organized peer-production processes, where contributions are marked not by their independence but by their interdependence. The Web as a whole requires no formal structure of cooperation. As an \"information good\" or medium, it emerges as a pattern out of coordinate coexistence of millions of entirely independent acts. All it requires is a pattern recognition utility superimposed over the outputs of these acts-a search engine or directory. Cooperation in peer-production processes is usually maintained by some combination of technical architecture, social norms, legal rules, and a technically backed hierarchy that is validated by social norms. The particular type of defection that the GPL protects against is appropriation of the joint product by any single individual or firm, the risk of which would make it less attractive for anyone to contribute to the project to begin with. Torvalds's authority is persuasive, not legal or technical, and certainly not determinative. He can do nothing except persuade others to prevent them from developing anything they want and add it to their kernel, or to distribute that alternative version of the kernel. There is nothing he can do to prevent the entire community of users, or some subsection of it, from rejecting his judgment about what ought to be included in the kernel. Anyone is legally free to do as they please. Torvalds's authority is persuasive, not legal or technical, and certainly not determinative.

There is nothing he can do to prevent the entire community of users, or some subsection of it, from rejecting his judgment about what ought to be included in the kernel. Anyone is legally free to do as they please. So these projects are based on a hierarchy of meritocratic respect, on social norms, and, to a great extent, on the mutual recognition by most players in this game that it is to everybody's advantage to have someone overlay a peer review system with some leadership. In combination then, three characteristics make possible the emergence of information production that is not based on exclusive proprietary claims, not aimed toward sales in a market for either motivation or information, and not organized around property and contract claims to form firms or market exchanges. First, the physical machinery necessary to participate in information and cultural production is almost universally distributed in the population of the advanced economies. Second, the primary raw materials in the information economy, unlike the industrial economy, are public goods-existing information, knowledge, and culture. Their actual marginal social cost is zero. Third, the technical architectures, organizational models, and social dynamics of information production and exchange on the Internet have developed so that they allow us to structure the solution to problems-in particular to information production problems-in ways The diversity of human motivation is nothing new. We now have a substantial literature documenting its importance in free and open-source software development projects, from Josh Lerner and Jean Tirole, Rishab Ghosh, Eric Von Hippel and Karim Lakhani, and others. As long as capitalization and ownership of the physical capital base of this economy remain widely distributed and as long as regulatory policy does not make information inputs artificially expensive, individuals will be able to deploy their own creativity, wisdom, conversational capacities, and connected computers, both independently and in loose interdependent cooperation with others, to create a substantial portion of the information environment we occupy. Most of the remainder of the book seeks to evaluate why, and to what extent, the presence of a substantial nonmarket, commons-based sector in the information production system is desirable from the perspective of various aspects of freedom and justice. the widely distributed model of information production will better identify the best person to produce a specific component of a project, considering all abilities and availability to work on the specific module within a specific time frame. Social relations provide the very motivations for, and information relating to, production and exchange, not only the institutional framework for organizing action, which itself is motivated, informed, and organized by markets or managerial commands. all kinds of goods, not only public goods. the relative economic role of sharing changes with technology. The technological state of a society, in particular the extent to which individual agents can engage in efficacious production activities with material resources under their individual control, affects the opportunities for, and hence the comparative prevalence and salience of, social, market-both price-based and managerial-and state production modalities. in moments where a field of action is undergoing a technological transition that changes the opportunities for sharing as a modality of production, understanding that sharing is a modality of production becomes more important, as does understanding how it functions as such. the prior arrangement may have been the most efficient, or even may have been absolutely necessary for the incumbent production system, its extension under new technological conditions may undermine, rather than improve, the capacity of a society to produce and provision the goods, resources, or capacities that are the object of policy analysis. The rise of social production does not entail a decline in market-based production. The rise of social production does not entail a decline in market-based production. Social production first and foremost harnesses impulses, time, and resources that, in the industrial information economy, would have been wasted or used purely for consumption. the company may engage with the social process in order to improve the probability that the required inputs will in fact be produced in time. In the case of companies like IBM or Red Hat, this means, at least partly, paying employees to participate in the open source development projects. But managing this relationship is tricky. The firms must do so without seeking to, or even seeming to seek to, take over the project; for to take over the project in order to steer it more \"predictably\" toward the firm's needs is to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. As the companies that adopt this strategic reorientation become more integrated into the peer-production process itself, the boundary of the firm becomes more porous. As firms have begun to experience these newly ambiguous relationships with individuals and social groups, they have come to wrestle with questions of leadership and coexistence. Users cannot be ordered around like employees. Nor can they be simply advertised-to and manipulated, or even passively surveyed, like customers. To do that would be to lose the creative and generative social managers must be able to identify patterns that emerge in the community and inspire trust that they are correctly judging the patterns that are valuable from the perspective of the users, not only the enterprise, so that the users in fact coalesce around and extend these patterns. The other quite basic change wrought by the emergence of social production, from the perspective of businesses, is a change in taste. Active users require and value new and different things than passive consumers did. The emerging businesses of the networked information economy are focusing on serving the demand of active users for platforms and tools that are much more loosely designed, late-binding-that is, optimized only at the moment of use and not in advance-variable in their uses, and oriented toward providing users with new, flexible platforms for relationships. The overarching point is that social production is reshaping the market conditions under which businesses operate. To some of the incumbents of the industrial information economy, the pressure from social production is experienced as pure threat. It is the clash between these incumbents and the new practices that was most widely reported in the media in the first five years of the twenty-first century, and that has driven much of policy making, legislation, and litigation in this area. How a society produces its information environment goes to the very core of freedom. The networked information economy makes individuals better able to do things for and by themselves, and makes them less susceptible to manipulation by others than they were in the mass-media culture. Unlike the relationship of information production to freedom, the relationship between the organization of information production and distributive justice is not intrinsic. Better access to knowledge and the emergence of less capital-dependent forms of productive social organization offer the possibility that the emergence of the networked information economy will open up opportunities for improvement in economic justice, on scales both global and local. The emergence of the networked information economy has the potential to increase individual autonomy. Peer-production projects often are composed of people who want to do something in the world and turn to the network to find a community of peers willing to work together to make that wish a reality. Each has decided to take advantage of some combination of technical, organizational, and social conditions within which we have come to live, and to become an active creator in his or her world, rather than merely to accept what was already there. The belief that it is possible to make something valuable happen in the world, and the practice of actually acting on that belief, represent a qualitative improvement in the condition of individual freedom. Users are individuals who are sometimes consumers and sometimes producers. They Users are individuals who are sometimes consumers and sometimes producers. Individuals can now justifiably believe that they can in fact do things that they want to do, and build things that they want to build in the digitally networked environment, and that this pursuit of their will need not, perhaps even cannot, be frustrated by insurmountable cost or an alien bureaucracy. the networked information environment opens new domains for productive life that simply were not there before. In doing so, it has provided us with new ways to imagine our lives as productive human beings. Autonomy theory that too closely aims to understand the degree of autonomy people actually exercise under different institutional arrangements threatens to form the basis of an overbearing benevolence that would undermine the very possibility of autonomous action. If we accept that all individuals are always constrained by personal circumstances both physical and social, then the way to think about autonomy of human agents is to inquire into the relative capacity of individuals to be the authors of their lives within the constraints of context. What matters is the extent to which a particular configuration of material, social, and institutional conditions allows an individual to be the author of his or her life, and to what extent these conditions allow others to act upon the individual as an object of manipulation. The first legal framework whose role is altered by the emergence of the networked information economy is the property-like regulatory structure of patents, copyrights, and similar exclusion mechanisms applicable to information, knowledge, and culture. \"Free,\" however, does not mean \"anything goes.\" A market that is more or less efficient will develop only if many other things are prohibited to, or required of, one or both sides-like monopolization or disclosure. Markets are, in other words, structured relationships intended to elicit a particular datum-the comparative willingness and ability of agents to pay for goods or resources. Property is a cluster of background rules that determine what resources each of us has when we come into relations with others, and, no less important, what \"having\" or \"lacking\" a resource entails in our relations with these others. While a necessary precondition for markets, property also means that choice in markets is itself not free of constraints, but is instead constrained in a particular pattern. It makes some people more powerful with regard to some things, and must constrain the freedom of action of others in order to achieve this asymmetry.2 Commons are an alternative form of institutional space, where human agents can act free of the particular constraints required for markets, and where they have some degree of confidence that the resources they need for their plans will be available to them. In particular, what typifies all these commons in contradistinction to property is that no actor is empowered by law to act upon another as an object of his or her will. As to information, then, we can say with a high degree of confidence that a more expansive commons improves individual autonomy, while enclosure of the public domain undermines it. The structure of our information environment is constitutive of our autonomy, not only functionally significant to it. A fundamental requirement of self-direction is the capacity to perceive the state of the world, to conceive of available options for action, to connect actions to consequences, to evaluate alternative outcomes, and to There are two primary types of effects that information law can have on personal autonomy. The first type is concerned with the relative capacity of some people systematically to constrain the perceptions or shape the preferences of others. A law that systematically gives some people the power to control the options perceived by, or the preferences of, others, is a law that harms autonomy. More fundamentally, a law that systematically makes one adult Law has created the conditions for one person to act upon another as an object. The second type of effect that law can have on autonomy is to reduce significantly the range and variety of options open to people in society generally, or to certain classes of people. \"Number and variety\" is intended to suggest two dimensions of effect on the options open to an individual. The first is quantitative. For an individual to author her own life, she must have a significant set of options from which to choose; otherwise, it is the choice set-or whoever, if anyone, made it so-and not the individual, that is governing her life. Beyond quantitative adequacy, the options available to an individual must represent meaningfully different paths, not merely slight variations on a theme. Qualitatively, autonomy requires the availability of options in whose adoption or rejection the individual if self-governance for an individual consists in critical reflection and re-creation by making choices over the course of his life, then some of the options open must be different from what he would choose simply by drifting through life, adopting a life plan for no reason other than that it is accepted by most others. If a law-passed for any reason that may or may not be related to autonomy concerns-creates systematic shifts of power among groups in society, so that some have a greater ability to shape the perceptions of others with regard to available options, consequences of action, or the value of preferences, then that law is suspect from an autonomy perspective. It makes the choices of some people less their own and more subject to manipulation by those to whom the law gives the power to control perceptions. As long as the focus of autonomy as an institutional design desideratum is on securing the best possible information flow to the individual, the designer of the legal structure need not assume that individuals are not autonomous, or have failures of autonomy, in order to serve autonomy. All the designer need assume is that individuals Throughout most of the 199os and currently, communications and information policy around the globe was guided by a wish to \"let the private sector lead,\" interpreted in large measure to mean that various property and property-like regulatory frameworks should be strengthened, while various regulatory constraints on property-like rights should be eased. The drive toward proprietary, market-based provisioning of communications and information came from disillusionment with regulatory systems and state-owned communications networks. The result of the push toward private provisioning and deregulation has led to the emergence of a near-monopolistic market structure for wired physical broadband services. Less than 2 percent of homes and small offices receive their broadband connectivity from someone other than their cable carrier or incumbent telephone carrier. The proprietary wired environment is gravitating toward a high-speed connectivity platform that will be either a lopsided duopoly, or eventually resolve into a monopoly platform.4 These owners are capable, both technically and legally, of installing the kind of policy routers with which I opened the discussion of autonomy and information law-routers that would allow them to speed up some packets and slow down or reject others in ways intended to shape the universe of information available to users of their networks. Commons-based wireless systems become the primary legal form of communications capacity that does not systematically subject its users to manipulation by an infrastructure owner. In this simple model, if the network is unowned, then for any communication all that is required is a willing sender and a willing recipient. No third agent gets a say as to whether any other pair will communicate with each other. Each agent determines independently of the others whether to If all network components are owned, on the other hand, then for any communication there must be a willing sender, a willing recipient, and a willing infrastructure owner. In a pure property regime, infrastructure owners have a say over whether, and the conditions under which, others in their society will communicate with each other. If all network components are owned, on the other hand, then for any communication there must be a willing sender, a willing recipient, and a willing infrastructure owner. In a pure property regime, infrastructure owners have a say over whether, and the conditions under which, others in their society will communicate with each other. It is precisely the power to prevent others from communicating that makes infrastructure ownership a valuable enterprise: One can charge for granting one's permission to communicate. Under anything less than a hypothetical and practically unattainable perfect market in communications infrastructure services, users of a proprietary infrastructure will face a less-than-perfect menu of influence exactions that they must accept before they can communicate using owned infrastructure. Adopting a regulatory framework under which all physical means of communication are based on private property rights in the infrastructure will therefore create a cost for users, in terms of autonomy. This cost is the autonomy deficit of exclusive reliance on proprietary models. If agents other than owners (advertisers, tobacco companies, the U.S. drug czar) value the ability to influence users of the infrastructure, then the influence-exaction component of the price of using the infrastructure will be sold to serve the interests of these third parties. To the extent that these influence exactions are effective, a pure private-property regime for infrastructure allows owners to constrain the autonomy of users. The owners can do this by controlling and manipulating the users' information environment to shape how they perceive their life choices in ways that make them more likely to act in a manner that the owners prefer. As we compare property to commons, we see that property, by design, introduces a series of legal powers that asymmetrically enable owners of infrastructure to exert influence over users of their systems. This asymmetry is necessary for the functioning of markets. Predictably and systematically, however, it allows one group of actors-owners-to act upon another group of actors-consumers-as objects of manipulation. Commons, on the other hand, do not rely on asymmetric constraints. They eliminate points of asymmetric control over the resources necessary for effective communication, thereby eliminating the legal bases of the objectification of others. These are not spaces of perfect freedom from all constraints. However, the constraints they impose are substantively different from those generated by either the property system or by an administrative regulatory system. The autonomy deficit of private communications and information systems is a result of the formal structure of property as an institutional device and the role of communications and information systems as basic requirements in the ability of individuals to formulate purposes and plan actions to fit their lives. The emergence of the networked information economy makes one other important contribution to autonomy. It qualitatively diversifies the information available to individuals. Information, knowledge, and culture are now produced by sources that respond to a myriad of motivations, rather than primarily the motivation to sell into mass markets. advertiser-supported media tend to program lowest-common-denominator programs, intended to \"capture the eyeballs\" of the largest possible number of viewers. These media do not seek to identify what viewers intensely want to watch, but tend to clear programs that are tolerable enough to viewers so that they do not switch off their television. The basic filter of marketability has been removed, allowing anything Given that all diversity within the industrial information economy needed to flow through the marketability filter, the removal of that filter marks a qualitative increase in the range and diversity of life options, opinions, tastes, and possible life plans available to users of the networked information economy. The image of everyone being equally able to tell stories brings, perhaps more crisply than any other image, two critical objections to the attractiveness of the networked information economy: quality and cacophony. None of the philosophical accounts of substantive autonomy suggests that there is a linearly increasing relationship between the number of options open to an individual-or in this case, perceivable by an individual-and that person's autonomy. Information overload and decision costs can get in the way of actually living one's autonomously selected life. Individuals must have access to some mechanism that sifts through the universe of information, knowledge, and cultural moves in order to whittle them down to a manageable and usable scope. The question then becomes whether the networked information economy, given the human need for filtration, actually improves the information environment of individuals relative to the industrial information economy. Relevance filtration and accreditation are integral parts of all communications. A communication must be relevant for filtration only enhances the autonomy of users if the editor's notions of relevance and quality resemble those of the sender and the recipient. Finally, and most important, just like any other form of information, knowledge, and culture, relevance and accreditation can be, and are, produced in a distributed fashion. the means of filtering data are being produced within the networked information The presence of filters that do not depend on proprietary control, and that do not bundle proprietary content production and carriage services with filtering, offers a genuinely distinct approach toward presenting autonomous individuals with a choice among different filters that reflect genuinely diverse motivations and organizational forms of the providers. Beyond the specific efforts at commons-based accreditation and relevance filtration, we are beginning to observe empirically that patterns of use of the Internet and the World Wide Web exhibit a significant degree of order. the structure of linking on the Internet suggests that, even without quasi-formal collaborative filtering, the coordinate behavior of many autonomous individuals settles on an order that permits us to make sense of the tremendous flow of information that results from universal practical ability to speak and create. We observe the Web developing an order-with high-visibility nodes, and clusters of thickly connected \"regions\" where groups of Web sites accredit each other by mutual referencing. The high-visibility Web sites provide points of condensation for informing individual choices, every bit as much as they form points of condensation for public discourse. The enormous diversity of topical and context-dependent clustering, whose content is nonetheless available for anyone to reach from anywhere, provides both a way of slicing through the information and rendering it comprehensible, and a way of searching for new sources of information beyond those that one interacts with as a matter of course. people tend to congregate around common choices. We do this not as a result of purposeful manipulation, but rather because in choosing whether or not to read something, we probably give some weight to whether or not other people have chosen to read it. Unless one assumes that individual human beings are entirely dissimilar from each other, then the fact that many others have chosen to read something is a reasonable signal that it may be worthwhile for me to read. The core response to the Babel objection is, then, to accept that filtration is crucial to an autonomous individual. Nonetheless, that acknowledgement does not suggest that the filtration and accreditation systems that the industrial information economy has in fact produced, tied to proprietary control over content production and exchange, are the best means to protect autonomous individuals from the threat of paralysis due to information overload. Property in infrastructure and content affords control that can be used to provide filtration. To that extent, property provides the power for some people to shape the will-formation processes of others. The adoption of distributed information-production systems-both structured as cooperative peer-production enterprises and unstructured coordinate results of individual behavior, like the clustering of preferences around Web sites-does not mean that filtration and accreditation lose their importance. It only means that autonomy is better served when these communicative functions, like others, are available from a nonproprietary, open model of production alongside the proprietary mechanisms of filtration. Being autonomous in this context does not mean that we have to make all the information, read it all, and sift through it all by ourselves. It means that the combination of institutional and practical constraints on who can produce information, who can access it, and who can determine what is worth reading leaves each individual with a substantial role in determining what he shall read, and whose judgment he shall adhere to in sifting through the information environment, for what purposes, and under what circumstances. Information, knowledge, and culture can now be produced not only by many more people than could do so in the industrial information economy, but also by individuals and in subjects and styles that could not pass the filter of marketability in the mass-media environment. The result is a proliferation of strands of stories and of means of scanning the universe of potential stories about how the world is and how it might become, leaving individuals with much greater leeway to choose, and therefore a much greater role in weaving their own life tapestry. The networked public sphere, as it is currently developing, suggests that it will have no obvious points of control or exertion of influence-either by fiat or by purchase. It seems to invert the mass-media model in that it is driven heavily by what dense clusters of users find intensely interesting and engaging, rather than by what large swathes of them find mildly interesting on average. \"public sphere.\" The term is used in reference to the set of practices that members of a society use to communicate about matters they understand to be of public concern and that potentially require collective action or recognition. The public sphere is, then, a sociologically descriptive category. It is a term for signifying how, if at all, people in a given society speak to each other in their relationship as constituents about what their condition is and what they ought or ought not to do as a political unit. The practices that define the public sphere are structured by an interaction of culture, organization, institutions, economics, and technical communications infrastructure. The Internet's effect on the public sphere is different in different societies, depending on what salient structuring components of the existing public sphere its introduction perturbs. The Internet allows individuals to abandon the idea of the public sphere as primarily constructed of finished statements uttered by a small set of actors socially understood to be \"the media\" (whether state owned or commercial) and separated from society, and to move toward a set of social practices that see individuals as participating in a debate. Statements in the public sphere can now be seen as invitations for a conversation, not as finished goods. Habermas defines the public sphere as \"a network for communicating information and points of view (i.e., opinions expressing affirmative or negative attitudes)\"; which, in the process of communicating this information and these points of view, filters and synthesizes them \"in such a way that they coalesce into bundles of topically specified public opinions.\"' my intention is to define a design question: What characteristics of a communications system and practices are sufficiently basic to be desired by a wide range of conceptions of democracy? With these in hand, we will be able to compare the commercial mass media and the emerging alternatives in the digitally networked environment. Any system of government committed to the idea that, in principle, the concerns of all those governed by that system are equally respected as potential proper subjects for political action and that all those governed have a say in what government should do requires a public sphere that can capture the observations of all constituents. requirement It is important not to confuse \"universal intake\" with more comprehensive ideas, such as that every voice must be heard in actual political debates, or that all concerns deserve debate and answer. Universal intake does not imply these broader requirements. It is, indeed, the role of filtering and accreditation to whittle down what the universal intake function drags in and make it into a manageable set of political discussion topics and interventions. However, the basic requirement of a public sphere is that it must in principle be susceptible to perceiving and considering the issues of anyone who believes that their condition is a matter appropriate for political consideration and collective action. A public sphere that has some successful implementation of universal intake must also have a filter to separate out those matters that are plausibly within the domain of organized political action and those that are not. The Second, the vast difference between the number of speakers and the number of listeners, and the finished-goods style of mass-media products, imposes significant constraints on the extent to which these media can be open to feedback-that is, to responsive communications that are tied together as a conversation with multiple reciprocal moves from both sides of the conversation. Concentration is a common word used to describe the power media exercise when there are only few outlets, but a tricky one because it implies two very distinct phenomena. The first is a lack of competition in a market, to a degree sufficient to allow a firm to exercise power over its pricing. This is the antitrust sense. The second, very different concern might be called \"mindshare.\" That is, media is \"concentrated\" when a small number of media firms play a large role as the channel from and to a substantial majority of readers, viewers, and listeners in a given politically relevant social unit. \"Newspapers are read at the breakfast table and dinner tables. God's great gift to man is appetite. Put nothing in the paper that will destroy it.\"12 Technically, blogs are part of a broader category of innovations that make the web \"writable.\" That is, they make Web pages easily capable of modification through a simple interface. blogs enable individuals to write to their Web pages in journalism time-that is, hourly, daily, weekly-whereas Web page culture that preceded it tended to be slower moving: less an equivalent of reportage than of the essay. Blogging software allows the person who runs a blog to permit some, all, or none of the readers to post comments to the blog, with or without retaining power to edit or moderate the posts that go on, and those that do not. The result is therefore not only that many more people write finished statements and disseminate them widely, but also that the end product is a weighted conversation, rather than a finished good. It is a conversation because of the common practice of allowing and posting comments, as well as comments to these comments. On the Web, linking to original materials and references is considered a core characteristic of communication."}
